You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, reading in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that hit you.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went to bleed to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom <unk>
I was doing it in secret.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years I felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could be invited to Cleveland, and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to get stuck with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as a woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today talked about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans aren't separated from nature and all interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around me <unk> in the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk> of snow year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall from glaciers or break down the ice shelves, break down.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give themselves and hold up until the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in an <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and themselves, in large as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere.
As it melts a iceberg unleashes fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of life forms.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it were the portraits of my ancestors, to know that in these unique moments exist in that way, and it will never exist to exist again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not a end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed in <unk>
It's very rarely actually going to witness a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg from average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want it to be too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about understanding itself, you're not going to pay attention to you.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X X chromosome goes into the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll come and talk about them later.
In my activity in my activity to play two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- to say, human bodies and <unk> how they've considered body fluid, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes -- <unk> to <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working -- for example, with twins <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than a half.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex sex, individuals whose physics couldn't fit into male male and conventional feminine
All of the general lines, we can get <unk>
<unk> adopt many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having sex that don't exist in the common forms or <unk>
For example, the case is the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels, but not reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developing, by a course as a <unk>
When you get the baby on it as a child.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing their death, but it doesn't have your menstrual period.
After doing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produced <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know their <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman most of women like me, are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> of <unk> to the <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> <unk> who had girlfriend, she had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life like a kid, and I had just figured out she had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosome and the <unk> glands were so active that it essentially created a male hormonal environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, the male component was exposed to.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with bacterial chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- that they have <unk> tissue, wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies have been -- whether they're <unk> <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> to <unk> is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is often based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people inside a body.
The most recent case is last year with the <unk> African <unk> <unk> <unk> put into the fabric of judgment his sex at the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called to wonder: "What do we test are going to do to determine whether or <unk> <unk> is male or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such one.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or men or women and <unk> and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were very stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly into <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology that is going on.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> from them in just a few <unk>
And as we go into the science and we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> arguments today -- not in public, but I know inside the <unk> when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved yet.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with the dilemma of really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to be able to be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit to me that he gets a little nervous,
We think these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were <unk>
It is from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a wonderful fan of gay <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The Founding <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain to you why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and we would compare it to another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents <unk> is the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming out of the blood of blood passed from grandfather and father and then and so on.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and the replaced for a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly what they were doing because they were part of a system that were <unk> where two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a world <unk>
They were getting rid of the explanations -- and so they were able to figure out the concept of power being passed out of a <unk> idea of the birth of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look back, for example, the Declaration of Climate talk about nature and god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And when we do that, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people from color that are going to include <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some 350 <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should give it before anatomy.
I don't want to say that for the age of five years they were allowed to allow the sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why will they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, you know, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
So Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: <unk> of March <unk>
For the only fact that he was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry <unk> right to sex consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
So Henry, to the virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now -- it's now <unk> from the <unk> compulsory of Mary doesn't have to worry.
And I read on his hand, it doesn't have the same rights to the marriage that Henry of all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman with a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that are in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much into the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For instance, Texas at a certain time has decided to be married with a man you don't have to have chromosome and get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests -- they get to people.
But this is also very strange because of the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> to the <unk>
So if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I wish <unk> to <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should be judge to judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be able to deal with this to help people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans that I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> smart decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships than the people than 40 that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's really hard.
And one part of me is what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to take this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to be killed, unless they're willing to have a change of sex in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had made light twins <unk> and then they pick them up and so they would take their name.
But when the phone was asked by the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, and he told me that in that other country -- these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum.
The United States offers tremendous possibilities to people who are <unk> to change by the time of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, I mean, I mean, I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as I could have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, -- and that is that I think there can be different ideas from different than different <unk> particularly if you're thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about studies of <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I thought about it as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the dumbest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with get rid of getting rid of the <unk> of gender, so there's nothing in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about her question, I think there's something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very adept at finding the way to protect people in the part of the state, you may have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body -- in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to engage new residents.
Well, right now, we are far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their building cost.
So easily we could <unk> the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just struggled for empty buildings only.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment were where they were owners, and that the other half still is not going to be <unk>
They could try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions that we can have the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, to build a whole new apartment building totally new, and when the rules of that place will build construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments were going to have new areas of reform large enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people -- they knew about their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential elections, <unk> <unk> imposed on a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his chief <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most <unk> ideas.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we sat together in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their <unk> cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> was called and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is only covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about to measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a city of a city that they could go to that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And we also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government who would need help from developing countries, they could benefit from the countries that are going to help us establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be trusted.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily <unk>
And shortly afterwards, on the January of January, they voted in Congress to bring it to the Constitution and add into a constitutional arrangement that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional constitutional era.
All the <unk> all over the <unk> the <unk>
By <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new grand center of the city which is being built in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years they got the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> so this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and they would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be able to have the Supreme Court for this new <unk>
There are urban and urban builders, which are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've figured out is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are lots of companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What would you think about to insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to engage new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before you show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and the most recently, photograph and post in my blog and colorful and different <unk> for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothing is <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce my <unk> impact on the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to meet people who are <unk> usually my money is going to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's about my size?
I'm like color color?
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would call for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you get to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
And inside this is exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I'd be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in underwear, --  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is my brilliant tiger calling me.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see it phenomenal at less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just love you."
<unk> <unk> of the child coming inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> Trust is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and outside there is no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We have to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very unique personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to feel emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be absolutely intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most members of this audience in this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need quite a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing can be just at a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't really do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the playing bar play with that parking lot, I showed him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics a few years -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, never nobody saw a <unk>
But it also didn't fit my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why he shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that's been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it to a little bit. It's found right at the center.
And then here we make a good good look at the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal little bit with a springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip, and I went to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> hole that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when you get other people up, and then I don't want to do those things, because I don't want to get them off -- or, really, I don't want to make them <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The voyage of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights then -- then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled everything out of the air, and then they put it to a temperature of less than one degree to zero zero.
Now, when I'm just going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting as he wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very weird forms.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way they <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft soft, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't know at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same little of metal is more or less than the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my kind of logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned on the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot to talk about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's <unk>
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that you are literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who is here and allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
Many negotiations and stories, it was going to be diagnosed with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply on this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I don't get married, but I had no access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than playing the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So let's go out, let's go <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click on, and we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and they <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with a single click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the hall,
I'm going to go ahead. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> about 10,000 million pixel up.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you can actually get about 10,000 million pixel up.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this looks like <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole on the Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull out the image, so you'll really see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and it really goes through it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create his own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just got a zooming in around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National <unk>
You can write things, send you to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating of these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, I think, even from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media makes justice to its artwork and is actually represented properly online.
And the big question to me today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy -- grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in commercial careers one in the last two decades.
You know, some time ago, if you wanted to win a racing career, one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you gained the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, it was <unk> control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're getting computers in the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms were going to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it down to the Moses -- in fact, you can still see a little <unk> and he said to yelling -- and he said <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what didn't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you only about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago, in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year in Italy that Italy won the World Cup
Maybe some remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, finally, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline.
By the afternoon, there are people here and there are called <unk>
It starts by the silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a call and go to the bathroom.
Second time, End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but what we use and consume it.
Today we know all about the input of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get it?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift, by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of the forms of <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we start <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're very complicated things and there are lots of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we just <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we <unk> one day still follows there.
So if we showed that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change in <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the second part we talked about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came to us and said Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water using water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, at a workshop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It creates like a water <unk> with pixels of water.
If the pixels fall out, you can write in them, display patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain is going to be open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
The entire building is made of water.
There are no windows no windows -- but when you come up with it it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all of the architecture is disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof gets down the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when almost all of architecture is gone.
Here it is working.
You see the people <unk> by what happens inside.
And here I am myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that open to let you pass it up, but a building that was still cutting down and water holes, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building in the physical pixels -- the pixels of water and the projections over them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and that every one had a little pixel that changes color as if it were a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, that moves with others in sync.
We could form this cloud,
So a flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the position of the pixel
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get anywhere near and look at it, and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to the bottom to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as motion capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with color and motion with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as an oyster nursery like a farm farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go through the digital world of the digital world of the power to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or CO2 emissions -- how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, together differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixel up.
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move inside the inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from down from the bottom to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go there.
As if it were a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better from what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you might better improve it by more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in the best way, be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you tell you.
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> You probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of us, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or perhaps that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to look at a doctor on the subject.
The great mission of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the Catholic Church <unk> wrote an essay called "No biology -- makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution -- consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
refers to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, that we're most interested in.
<unk> from a common ancestor with the modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk>
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is the <unk> that comes out of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all took in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Perhaps 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> you know about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
And the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients you can want to want to be <unk>
It really is like a quick pathway to bacteria with occasional disruption of some <unk> <unk>
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single one and unique <unk> and human life, a little bit of funny.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms each cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two political cells.
But when <unk> organisms appear to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one could say that the <unk> of the body death goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I was getting more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a slight <unk> <unk>
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
"It's fine. He says, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to make us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to happen to the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of view, you and I are as a reinforcing rockets that was designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let us drop to the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling by Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily make longevity.
Not necessarily favors the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the more intelligent the smarter.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only human and success test.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive to the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look at the way ahead of the <unk> phase -- I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and wiped out from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to fit to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of the traditional kind of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we get older, when we have distant planets going to exist, and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive and scary possibility.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and the chosen for us as individuals in the decisions that we want.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you pick up at the individual and a family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex in your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or lower disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes on their <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of changes will become increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the 20,000 and a week.
Not much to be a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly <unk>
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course with the vaccine against the flu <unk> in cells from a seed plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today, and in the future it's going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating the diabetes, eliminate <unk> reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases us are going to allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100 thousand years and we can go to 1,000 years to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in making a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively selectively are different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more even more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have we face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. It was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already caught the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
We put the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words that have been heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't do that all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never had.
While I was thinking about that, later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open it up.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while we took the bridge George Washington, which wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also took place to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my father's relationship with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to get <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mind clock is going <unk> 14 <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had a sense of, Whoa! I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love you, I love my life.
And that sadness will become a single thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason to be the world.
At that point I understood when I connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in the way.
You know, you're flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please don't be this -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are being the best parents that we want.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after I run and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the start of ALS.
Today <unk> has total paralysis to that.
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so the graffiti is a kind of intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second one, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be an important one, and you have a certain good thing you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accessible for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way -- they are making it with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I met her brother and her father there at that very moment, right now -- "All right, this is the Tony Tony going to speak, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who gets so much inside of your inner can't afford it.
So I talked to a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer to draw it and register negative space.
So they go out there doing art facilities like this.
All the things that I <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in its <unk>
And so this started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much move things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we cut to the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine so that you could <unk> it would be a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy is getting an email from him, and you say, "I don't know it. This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the <unk> world from all the corner of <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a couple of cheap sun that we buy in the <unk> Beach, some copper wire and some copper wire and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on a light light and now there's a device that's free -- and that's free -- and it builds up, we published the <unk> code for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to tell.
There is no hospital that I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming my whole night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We run the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot, so we feel like we were looking at graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out of there so I could take it away.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
This is a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine told us as one of the 50 major inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up with the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible, do it.
None of the stuff in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with mathematical recognition technology, I just recognized something and I was telling me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like we need to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years -- in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as much as dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It Film City <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to have just this -- fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations looking horrible with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that <unk> <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that was <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights on the name of my TEDTalk <unk>
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could be <unk> in your face, especially if I put it into ridiculous you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I would not have been able to do it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been stuck in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could <unk> it anything could be done for something that difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to try to try and product <unk> and advertising, and that all the film will be engaged with <unk> of marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call the largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, all of the brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of this X X in the title, but we're going to make sure to use all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and it becomes the biggest shoe that you've got to.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film, never <unk> the best drink you have <unk> from "The <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> But I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting with them, but that is certainly going to be worth convincing you to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What's going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be taught.
MS: But it will be difficult for the film or being I?
JK: Both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he would go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant having a conversation outside of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies disappeared.
None wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the dead media, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth that new vehicle is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this picture.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey way."
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in practical practices -- the last line is perhaps the last line perhaps the bigger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this little rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and told you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to say, "No, we want you to <unk>
We want you to take a story, but you want <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in a lie -- and that's he staring at me, as I used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take off to me and go to business myself.
So what I started to see all of a sudden -- that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant movies, and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason they have so much success is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who do independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, <unk> movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you well cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You're ready? You're ready?
I want to help you that you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there I offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> from the <unk> will have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to call it solid, to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
They get into the kind of little smaller movies that we have, we are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, to remind people is the reason why this makes us care.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this positive category versus <unk> smell and <unk>
You keep <unk>
How do you keep you fresh, more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
It's things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man from the street, to the people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors -- lots of gray colors and so on.
Usually I'm wearing works like sunglasses, or <unk> or <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call him <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In some <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They need toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my tiny, little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we don't all have to make it Tom Tom, but I often scratched me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they certainly could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape a way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case come from and start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be.
I like different things.
I like things weird -- I like things weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what it does for us?
What is the <unk> What is the phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot crazy to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be focused on one of their strong points or elsewhere, instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to -- and it's nature's nature to avoid things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements -- and you are actually supporting them and make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand, which is your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your identity up, your brand, your brand, what would it be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a attribute of a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary or bold or bold <unk> like <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic <unk>
Or are you more of the attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how now they use MRI MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the schools in the schools with animal problems in America.
The incredible thing to me is that projects in which I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no interest in my mind.
I'm going to try directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do thinking about people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does he gone? They did success?
Well, since the film was sent in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no press, no TV either.
The film is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to gain momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talked about to their customers will not be part.
I always believed that if you get a risks, that in those risks that are opportunities.
I think when you get out to people that's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of risk is preparing all of their business for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we need to bring it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. Look at the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> shows <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: And so, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix -- the Foundation, which is a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that are controlling speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software are from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we began to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these boxes, these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were going to put up our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> were <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
It had no sense to me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching for the gray box, if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place.
If not, you don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than you get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two small bombs -- a small one and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally people who obviously had any internal information.
It was breaking all the points for those to attack.
You probably even know how much you would go to the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell them, the payload is very complex.
It's very much over everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were calls to the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and structures of data and tried to deal with the real world with the real world with potential the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> because it has to be a valuable, and it's probably sitting in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
You don't find a number of thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant, and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them to be a <unk> effort in the experience of what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is the goal of the attack was making it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> out in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to research scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A pretty <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
Because there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken from several weeks of hard work.
They were going to take it into dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would say that both digital <unk> would look like one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little tiny little guy is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw -- I really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of sensors for example, from pressure sensors and audio sensors and provide <unk> code, which is still running during the attack with false data from the entrance to <unk>
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed up <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital safety system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act quickly.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open up vacuum valves.
Obviously, this can't do a human activity.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to tell you is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a factory factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> to disseminate this payload with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be more possible.
And if you made that, with what it <unk> is with a mass of mass destruction.
That's the implication that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take you and give them <unk> skills or another one that makes users of chairs just raise them and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
These are nothing different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing your speed, and helps it aid, for example, how to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect to the universe and with other magnificent <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take over their back a 45 pounds of <unk> and it's <unk> to bring even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, within 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage,
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or let me introduce <unk> Human Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can spend 90 pounds for variables for many hours.
His flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run movements with great <unk>
I mean, what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's look back at the users of chairs from the wheelchair, and what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, instead of wheelchair chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people with damage in the spinal cord that when they start their life -- in 20, 40 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got a few sensors ...
completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back.
And there are a little bit of batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural ride.
AB: I was just 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, on the air, <unk> <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything from <unk>
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> will never get to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last hint of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> climbing rocks and even ride into a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to affect the future of future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the chairs of chairs from the <unk> everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the German Man Times or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of rainforests in Congo.
<unk> are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done very emphasis on this in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been marketed for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation does not be able to fill in a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
As humans, as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is critical to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him, we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, behavioral diversity of connections.
And when you look at the play, Bonobo sees the root roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual in humans.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how they play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with fresh water.
I think that, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these skills.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> the maximum <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
<unk> and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the right thing to play, it can be the moments where it's the most <unk>
For that, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, they were doing fires as a captain a captain of a captain in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers flee a highly skilled staff one has to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the full night, she was standing outside the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and save the dog's owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, he would have to tell the people that I walked into a fire building to save a living room just because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get into the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected to do, but I was <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the firemen <unk> that at that height or less had finished off the fire off, and I walked into the room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures of house where, as he was expected, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house of home <unk> by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as voluntary fireman is witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're in the <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you to remind you of this:
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, let's go back now.
It took food in a dining hall, which is a neighborhood park.
be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you go to <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks are built in <unk> with a very simple idea of cement modules from a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 buildings per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> I simply adopted the block block, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex circuits at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just just to experts.
I personally don't believe that that the building blocks of our time are reserved at the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is they put together by magnets.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
The bricks have a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the stream, the pink is the input and the color of color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue one with one green and very quickly you can start to make major circuits.
One blue one with one green is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to show, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slow down, just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind the <unk> is that it's a growing growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world <unk> to <unk> bricks and use.
<unk> <unk> panels, <unk> <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics on electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, only in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something.
So here is an example of a project that have done, an area of <unk> in the motion.
But wait, here is my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to get all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world to inventors inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interaction world is ours.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking to engage with the environment in the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
And we had a few members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> to <unk>
And it's a parking lot in the city of Boston.
Here it looks like I would look at a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody has to clean up when it stays caught by snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment I spent a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can adopt a <unk>
You keep <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can make it <unk>
I mean, it has a playground.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something another technology of the government <unk>
And it extends into viral ways.
A responsible for <unk> systems in the city of <unk> to see this application realized that he could use it not for snow, but for the citizens <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of the tsunami, but people steal the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens that the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just just <unk> to get people to get rid of sidewalks when they were going.
So now we know about nine cities that we use to use it.
And this has spread out of <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best school for their children.
Then they told us that I had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two years and took about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the California court power that until the time has two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days, and it was <unk> it's kind of a shot of warning from the institution of government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not as in private companies, like many people think they should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we would build together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
You haven't given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration for that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is, if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we get crazy about, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they are alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made us out of -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way it thought of it will affect the way that it will make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about <unk>
This is the phone center for services and information.
It's the place that serves calls if you're a brand <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music good and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no phone center.
It has a <unk> and <unk> called <unk> <unk>
We didn't get that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually gets this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, he found the garbage back behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, they go to the communities.
If we call animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the <unk>
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> we sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will take our values and make it our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
So below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds that that is that we funded as something that we funded in our <unk> that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report <unk> report in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> ourselves to the government, is time to ask ourselves, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really think we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get out of government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can be able to expand it to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> just to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of age of the age of members is 28 years old, so I am, I am a older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't really matter to be able to hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They get their hands on the work to program applications that are going to work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> pulling out <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage <unk>
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are kind of like digital <unk> that we are not just consumers, not only the consumers of government who we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us will be a swarm of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here have impact on the whole world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right -- my job.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in any discussion in the family.
She <unk> lots of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way you saw the world.
She was a tough but she was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at her, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I fell on.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was going to be approaching me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, no, I got back again and if I said yes, I was in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is that it had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight to nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it and I was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, and she went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it were yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I don't <unk> I said, "Sure."
And I sat down, and he sat down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "I just want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you're always going to do the right thing -- although the right thing is it?
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I have never been <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in south <unk> I have a brother a year older and sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he gave him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You go back, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I won't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
He came up with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I have never taken a alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we need to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there is 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the biggest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, you're found so much <unk> so many despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, L.A., Baltimore in Baltimore to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all of the color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with ours.
We are <unk>
I think it's interesting.
We're looking at our work some good developments curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well in other states, you know about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black black population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if you show it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of loss of loss to be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he was <unk> 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility to go out.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people to people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a certain sense we've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not trying to decide whether people deserve to die by crime crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Out of every nine deaf people has identified one which is innocent and released from death corridor death.
An <unk> rate, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't allow you to ever fly airplanes if every single nine than <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students in history -- I'm talking about slavery to you.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that it lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our face for the first time with terrorism.
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of Ford and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've done.
And all of the time we did with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage us with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's fair to hear what you <unk>
<unk> "We don't have death in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There's no way to our history, we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> us to run the people."
So let's talk about this.
How do we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both of those things.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe that we haven't seen it.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so <unk>
The development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no <unk> related to the technology and the design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to inequality, to inequality, an injustice.
Now I want to imagine that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered just to talk about.
Occasionally, I was called to be called to go, <unk> comes <unk>
You want to come and look at it.
I said, "Yes, lady. I know I do."
So she was like, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just look at them.
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's tell me how to be that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end up with <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be too much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for the other.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst than we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very exhilarating, not to be judge by our technology, by our designs, or by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich and powerful ones, but because of the way they treat the poor, they prescribe their prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
And I am sometimes going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, that have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge actually turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge made it as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was awake <unk> by God, if the judge can turn it into something you don't, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> client with a small, poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated like a privileged of 75 years from a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there were been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only there was no time, but he had sent it to court.
About two months, I had forgotten that.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the cut this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car walking around the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He's <unk> "It's you. "It's you.
So I approached myself and <unk> me.
And I got rid of the ear, they <unk>
He said, "I'm proud to <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
By coming in, the judge saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> and we started argue.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came the policemen the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. We're all mad because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and you would hear that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and over there.
Finally, this old black man, with a concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the board table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed him upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black man.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> this audience room to tell this young man to keep her view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't really be human <unk> if we don't really care about human rights and by dignity.
That our survival is linked to others.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those people here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which we're going to make a <unk> effort to fund the funds that are spent today for punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty over the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases in homicide -- not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that it will spread these funds to make the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> Actually, the <unk> rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on the <unk>
That's why this has been this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince ourselves by the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> <unk> for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about this right now.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats for bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> This is just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six days of years.
The idea is that media would say, negative news, because our minds are paying attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting more data than the brain that probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing else matters to survive, the first stop of all that data is an ancient excerpt from the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could be hurt.
So from a <unk> of stories, we will look at the negative.
That old saying to the <unk> "If there's blood and <unk> it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we're <unk>
It is not surprising that people think that the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress that has done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of the species, the water scarcity and <unk> without any doubts we have.
As human beings are very good for solving the problems, and in the long time, we've just got them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> income per capita adjusted for inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food food, electricity and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy was 25 percent to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep getting higher expectations more and higher expectations ...
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty have electricity, water toilets, <unk> TV, and air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of <unk>
We have a lot of this is the technology and, lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend of Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession to recession.
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production all over the planet, synthetic biology, our fuels and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and
I mean, how many saw the victory to the "Jeopardy" of <unk>
It was <unk>
I <unk> the best headline that I would <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to everyone on your cell phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think of that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of as possible.
It's about taking that that's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate on <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So for that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum for that.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like metal.
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made out of the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it were <unk>
It <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the scarcity of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electric electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the age of 15 national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager Voyager spacecraft towards the Earth, in 1990, then it was <unk>
<unk> a very famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's an available technology, not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small fridge in a while.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> saltwater, fresh water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
President of Coca-Cola just thought that I will make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in that to be a Coca-Cola to be able to put it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation, because of this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it on cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, technology of diagnostic diagnosis -- now <unk> and lose value value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to get to when you show the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X Prize, which is about 10 million dollars.
We're going to challenge the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> they can get <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the health and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are population.
We've just got the mark of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, to spend two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you have to get into the global conversation.
What do these people?
What would you <unk> What wishes to <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of Academy of Academy -- and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
What about a few voices never before <unk>
How about it if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that these small teams guided by their passion with an objective of course, can do things that are <unk> things that could only make major corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some already heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played these university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is a better folding thing that the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovator <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are focused on to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we need to do.
We have for a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
We <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, on the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets they still say they're still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 percent, the black battery <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made more than a half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
They went to five centimeters.
They have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishery in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe, did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty <unk> was called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the Sea of China <unk> and, mostly in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny spots about <unk> remains that fish from coral Reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing fishing.
The bottom happens about being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living one.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to get it off, because it was a good food.
This mountain mountain is what they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's no <unk>
We don't remember it.
You bring the point to start to start to start to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at it something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things that are biodiversity, many of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use images to use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the kind of changes.
And at the end, I keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in a big extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when anonymous societies kill animals without knowing what they have done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal which is very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a conflict with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence was presented in an early way that they would expect that they would have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them are <unk> as a captain of a captain such and as a look at many fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the scientists from the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From the big role that it can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with marine marine areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point is run and very low.
That's for the people who can see a marine marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle West, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe they can fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we engage with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is where to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made and what the importance are made and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, it copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done by the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a little percentage of the viral one gets infinite and infinite visits and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: of trends, communities of participation and compelling things.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> at the rise of popular summer.
<unk> I wasn't saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that would send the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> gave us new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everybody wants me to arrive at the end of week, the weekend.    <unk> Friday. <unk> on a Friday.  KA: Wouldn't you think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
He was going to say to Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often use use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed like there seemed to have come from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a creators group will take a view of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that I woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did an old version of it.
And then it became international made.
All of a sudden, it came up a whole community of <unk> that made this sort of stupid joke to something that we can all form around.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written by this situation?
In a world where you spend two days of video per minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really bother me.
Casey Martin <unk> I was terrified of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that can be accessed properly by <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and its humor, Casey who had been able to get five million watched and understand his idea.
So this is this approach to all the new things that we do differently?
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of involving creative communities, creative communities, totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media -- in a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features -- it's just the current media -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> one man burning the work of a whole life.
This is a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the sole hope and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> enter the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long friends, now friends, now <unk>
They get into silence.
He died broken through history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but they did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old, when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small <unk>
For her, life had been destined to be driven to a <unk> task, the escape.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction fiction, a boat slid into the sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the corals and the death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were <unk> we would take away my sister and you would take my sister and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember <unk> who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to drop for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and finish the journey was too much for it; and the first apple that I tried to, given by the men on the platform.
No apple got the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women along three generations to shape a new life combined.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is made of immigrants from immigrants to us.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments in English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car line, working six days -- double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> title of the <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra quartile in English and math, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which is usually <unk> clothes was always <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide those holes from the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I went into the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were telling us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmares started to be able to come back.
She opened a computer store, and then I studied for <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and <unk> and <unk> <unk> caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic classical student, relentless with what was <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse, and <unk>
But many of them received aid through the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer were elected by the old Australian girl.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges don't <unk>
So <unk> anonymously <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and activist activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in homes that she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfortable feeling of life in a suburb -- <unk> a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> about the day of every single <unk> and <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was at the same age that she had when she got into the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about to speak to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what we were going to live on, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new and not only it's fine, but it's something to be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily be able to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
So let's go to a small group of people for the <unk> <unk> not <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was doing a giant <unk> <unk>
It would be <unk> to night at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we open up step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
And then a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he made a lock into the <unk> and take the cause she himself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't make it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and said to us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have easily faced.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to do for it?
But I fear the privilege of the easy right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives -- <unk> courageous on each wave, the <unk> pace of the motor, the <unk> the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and see them safe, I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also stem mother here today, in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior Indian, he was <unk> he was <unk> he was <unk> and he was <unk> and he was able to get a bow on the ground, I could get water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I was telling me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As my girl, my grandfather gave me his pocket.
And this piece of <unk> was for my most <unk> thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them prevent them.
Tell our inspiration.
So I <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how it would use to create magic, rather than <unk>
I took books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a device of narrative that can connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with the image, animation and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that use us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to you, I write my name.
And so I get a picture of the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but <unk> but to that magic magic, to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned to me exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And they really light your way into what the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that rises <unk> and you drive you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary of contemporary people.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a history that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take camera or iPad, and collect pictures of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual of childhood we have to go out and in a chapter, and it would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between the magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of <unk> that appear on inner inner plants.
And at a moment, the screen is full of leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology to come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all of all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail now that we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's very simple.
It has a switches of <unk> and closed up.
Every morning I grew up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I get to me, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time that it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that style is, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers, and on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my scale scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week it will be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people have been able to get away from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they give them to their doctor, to share it with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to control the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges that we face, as the gunshot costs of attention to demand and other issues.
They are techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video of a video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know exactly where the ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are they all <unk>
And of course, we can find strings from fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but no one was <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes it is open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and then the next few weeks will use their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to do it globally.
We are <unk> to all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us witness these <unk>
They could be a <unk> service services, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows up in their place.
Please take it into this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you press the <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal to keep the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to look like it would have been captured in a sort of photograph.
And you have to think about what you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look true.
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What do you create the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it comes to our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but of what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you an easy example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic I think they're those in which we don't even consider the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important, because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules to continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they took the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of places.
In personal people, I think it's easier to create a place that you find it because you don't need to put the ideas on the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a rock.
And yes, even I did red the top house of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic outcome I think it needs planning.
You always start with an idea.
Then you have to combine different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start by showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested to show you the details but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'll talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
We got more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technology <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to look at, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look at it, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb -- we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport is as fast as <unk> in <unk> we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development -- that every few years will orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves that we see don't forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We took one of two things.
Or it will turn into a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
From being so, we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way for the world?
Why is why new state is directing the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
So we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about a billion and a half billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals were organized and we give them an idea of how things happened.
And I think there is theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that's that, at that time, there was some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical prescriptions inside.
Some of those oil droplet had had a particular combination of chemicals that they made them to incorporate materials out of the outside the outside and the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we want.
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that in some way they were getting better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more chemicals -- more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life chemistry, very simple, but things get interesting when these drops the trick of the abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well -- they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were for <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved and two billion years ago.
Our recipe is our genes, they have exactly the same code, that writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport people on the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and 10 to 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then another big step in which things are very different, and it was that these cells started to trade and to communicate information in the cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin to create their little DNA to create their little bacteria, and now there's lots of resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be forming communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community, they were getting more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities came to me so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities, we have communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have lots of cells not act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the brain cell or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more to process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those building cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> to understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to have a certain amount of fruit, because I knew it wrong and got sick of the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that is accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the magic trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea to be a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, kind of <unk> and <unk> in your heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated to make it sound, in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making <unk>
We now go through similar periods of space that <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and the information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer video, the <unk> and so on. It's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
And the second one, the language, they took less than a million years.
And crows like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that makes its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to do it in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that glass machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine, and the machine with that does something that you didn't could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We said, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions at chance?
You could run these random instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> to the rest.
And now we need the best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children would take the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs out of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
So let's add some mutations in.
And it tries to get it back and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated, within a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are going to sequence absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are strangers.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I once went in a 747 -- with <unk> <unk> and it takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand from all the choices there are.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so could run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing goes every time faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it's the lunch and I think it stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give me a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I was dealing with my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be coming out -- <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> who was <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to get to the first base -- it doesn't come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
3 <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 car <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place away, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor is derived by a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But do you know what?
She's getting better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask you.
What do you think that should be the average hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I would include me with the perfect <unk>
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I did when I was in medical school.
I was a graduate student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied for a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses in nurses at the General General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> human diagnosis -- frequent <unk> and not usual.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were going to save everything, then you would know everything, or as far as possible, close to the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident at a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the <unk> lady in the emergency service where I worked on.
At the time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when I applied to the emergency room to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
I would report to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which <unk> a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are full of blood, and that's why there's a hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would <unk>
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on their heart.
I gave him a <unk> <unk> so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes more.
I sent him home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was called my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring up information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to pay attention to.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it home, he didn't take attention to a voice on my inner mind that he was like, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, he was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that he would ask Mrs. <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if he's going to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it were yesterday.
So it was that he signed up the ambulance and the ambulance along with the people who took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went through my work.
At the end of the day, he would be able to leave the hospital and I walked down to the parking lot where my car was to go home. So I did something that I don't do normally, normally, I <unk>
I went through the emergency emergency service on the home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was born from Mrs. <unk> before, but another one -- he told me three words, those three words that most skilled doctors <unk>
Other specialists are also afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> which is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
Well, she said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
And she was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour of having come to her home, after I was a high <unk> he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought them to emergency with a blood pressure on 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock severe.
Just breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff, all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the cores.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and waiting against all hope that he <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never danced.
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be transferred to what was going on.
And the ninth day, they left him go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks, I was terrified for that, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept following those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little in that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, it was opened up the sky and finally came out of the Sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were going to have the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to make more errors, would cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to cease to
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was teaching the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, he was a bit <unk>
She sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he was headed to the door followed his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked me to talk to me in your office.
And he made the three words: <unk> what?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
He came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition.
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because it's an infection, but it can be the top, and it can cause the close to those tracks.
He didn't die.
You were forced antibiotics to go <unk> and recovered within a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
He <unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out. A colleague I was checking up with the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He read liquid to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it and when you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner. I called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case I was excited about each case, I got <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get to talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can you share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for not the same <unk>
If I could go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failing, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- I think I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
This is the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and people who don't sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you care about medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a poor medical study and errors in order to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for Toronto, "Star <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital they're wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system where the infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, there are 24 Canadian Canadian <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going down every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, come up with <unk> eyes and <unk> to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't make things always be the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't know their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get into us, and we eliminate all the professionals prone to wrong, well, wouldn't there be anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah. "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to go down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The American phone is human, and they accept it, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They do not with the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way of loving and support.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes occasionally, in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a doctor.
I am human <unk>
And I feel a lot, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that says to pick an average American -- are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot of a research ago in research followed by a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are used by these executives and the time that we were trying to make things related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the <unk> category of <unk>
How do they grade the way that they manipulate these decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems in the <unk> to choose to the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for you to give you a <unk>
And now my first question of day, are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> at a very, very <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of 25 water <unk> and this was when you take water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion I asked myself, why don't I buy anything?
This is a shelf from the oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that were coming from trees.
I once decided to go to the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
I put a post for <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put it out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop at <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was only three percent of the time he had to buy <unk>
And you stood when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have less -- it's good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choices is affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of hedge funds available on savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program would help people save for the future.
And we found that there was really a <unk>
We had plans that were from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of funds -- there were fewer participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that give two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's unintended consequences.
So for the people who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, more people are being committed to avoid stocks or investment.
As the more options, you were more willing to invest in financial bank accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative implications for the more and more possibilities.
The more likely it is to make the decision, that the <unk> even when this is going against our self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things out less <unk> even though they objectively it better.
The main reason is that we would be able to look at that vast variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so that we can contrast to, and to pick up that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so they can test in their business.
The first is: <unk>
You've been hearing before, but it's never been more true than today, than less than it is.
People always laugh when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is getting more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of that strange <unk> choices, there will be an increased sales increase, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> saw 15 percent rise in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for waste of cats that less <unk> became increased by <unk> by two <unk> major sales and lower costs.
It is known to force them on average today, they offer 45,000 products.
In a store of Walmart -- you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce <unk>
In the world, I think that one of the best examples that have arisen on how to handle the choices is the <unk> <unk> <unk> program.
All employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a lifetime of life.
The people who really want a choice, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences between those options.
And if your employees can't be able to do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience on vacation with every single paid road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take an applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They are not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first round, that in the second, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> of options.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete,
Why is people spend 15 percent to 30 percent on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were going to have a <unk> plan.
So to that meeting that we did exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would tell the staff that you would think about the positive things that would be <unk> in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hall of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> across the corridor of <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But do you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something to you who are not going to have the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of fundraising.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if just a little bit, a little bit.
We have to increase complex complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a really good decision -- buying a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that enables <unk>
You have to make 60, you have to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices with each other.
<unk> color outside of the car, I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order that the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four watt to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much do you are.
If you have a <unk> there's always the default button in each decision, this is that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from many options to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though we pick the box of changes to not say nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternate alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> that we can run more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, to use them in their own business, or for people who are working on.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful you are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter I had to write to the government.
You had to register an example of text of example written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of that someone could do this, how much this is going to give us the freedom of expression.
We will never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and it prints one page, that page end up having some little yellow dots printed on each page that you follow a pattern that makes them own and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would take money from their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy on <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret secret in America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this is a <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a <unk> victim from a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crimes online <unk>
The second group of the <unk> that we see today is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate them to motivate them, they motivate laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role on the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who make it to protest and the last group are the United States the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a nonprofit authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the bill last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site, and they hit a <unk>
Last week, I asked him at a meeting with the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do we serve the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we have a foreign <unk>
And they repeat <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt Egypt was the headquarters for the secret secret police in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to investigate its own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
Will the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems like something bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have to do today, is forever.
So blindly <unk> in any future government, in a management of the <unk>
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the south of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the largest part, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of those who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value that much.
So I grew up, and I grew up with lions.
They were dying are the warriors that protect our community and livestock and also bother the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A kid in my community, six to nine at nine years is responsible for livestock and father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that actually not <unk> because they even helped lions see the pen away.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But male lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So broke and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, male lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the door and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
They were going to get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell burden the battery and the battery will put electricity into the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how they see it when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> You can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, hyenas, <unk> and it's also using it to add elephants from the farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that don't have, and teach them how to do it.
So a year ago, it was just a kid on meadows in the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes and fly, and he told me that someday I would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come on to TED.
My big dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to your CA: CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that there are already invented biological fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it back at once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every step you have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> story but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Though I asked myself to ask me about the rest of the world, I thought that would happen my whole life in North Korea, until it was all changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there exist in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child on her arms by looking at the face of her mother without able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine is coming out to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy, all around me was completely dark on the night except for the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the edge between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't really reveal the details of how left came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I only thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like an Afghan refugee
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the refugees North North China were illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was arrested at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Though there was eventually released after the harsh pressure of international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to leave, many other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided I'm going to be going to <unk>
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I was hoping for.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the exam of income to college.
Just when I was starting to join my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had some money sent to my family, and like punishment my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location remote in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started to plan how to help you escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea, and South Korea, and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to fit them in some way, for more than three thousand miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by an Chinese police officer.
He asked them to get all of us and ask them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
And I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and interrupted my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated over again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all about liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At the time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans, to get them from prison.
And I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> she said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown is a new hope for me and for the people to be able to do it when more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea, and my family and I met in South Korea.
But getting their freedom is just half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they prescribe to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the language language, practical practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to get in contact with family in the way we continue to go on and send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help giving Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you are going to see more and more North American Koreans around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast <unk>
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Central so that it represents something else, so they changed the South L.A. as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles   <unk> of <unk> food, fast <unk>
Just like that, millions of other American Americans, living in a food desert -- Los Angeles <unk> home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to bring people to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would stop seeing this happening.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time they go home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has on your <unk>
I see a wheelchair <unk> and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
And then I already got tired of my driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> strip that we call a <unk>
It's 45 by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what come to me in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to do it."
This is how I decided to keep going.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> <unk> we get together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine different vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a group of a group paid by gardeners of all the <unk> across the whole city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city came to me on top and summary to me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, the <unk> became <unk>
And I was saying, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's look at it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more integrated terrain.
It's got <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central Central science.
That's enough space to plant <unk> million vegetable plants.
Why the hell does it not look like this?
We put a plant to give a thousand, 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, I cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South ships.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Just like an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, they're my <unk> of that canvas.
They were trying to see what the Earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education, in transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, who was like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad enough to be there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like that.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people who were so close to hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> no temes that people go to steal your <unk>
So I say, "Oh God no, I'm not afraid to go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed it, so just for a moment.
So the Green Green has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, they are going to eat them, they eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food affects your mind and body, eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see color guys that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of cultivate their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to see me, I don't call me in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing anything shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a pretty nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains too much.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you can see.
And especially if you're <unk> on your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a quiet road.
The solution to that is to make road <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so all the water of rain flow over the sides and you have a road because it's easy to drive, and it doesn't waste water anymore.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the <unk> <unk> so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface are gone.
So first a stone, and then several more and more and more and more and so on, and so on, and it will not do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage is in this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they are <unk> they will be <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
So to solve this problem, we think about materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is you can use wool and steel wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel and steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits from the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to make a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are going back to the surface.
Today this is a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine to put it onto the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested lots of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road is going to last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made aging for samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the ones and then put them up with our <unk> machine, and we put them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel, incorporating them these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, they even may increase the life of the surface.
And now, of course, you're curious about it as well.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you how it works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the <unk> sound in my house.
My father was hearing BBC News in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally called the news.
"The Taliban <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and they made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be used out, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be able to do it.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going to be.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school was born, suddenly for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to come from?
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. And that his daughter, my mother, went to school and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their kids had to get education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate your children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can try to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you still want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He not just <unk> from my university degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who took him on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador for a global campaign to educate the women.
It's because of what you do: <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite them, despite them and even in front of a opposition opposition in them.
As a <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
So less than a month, he and her daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When he gets to her home, it is the phone, a voice told him that if they followed his daughter to school, they would try to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes would not last long after the U.S. U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who would take care of them, that the <unk> I see the future <unk> and a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent nearly two years since the Tunisian revolution broke by the wave of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside of the country to call a road day and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men -- they were in the middle, <unk> the fall of the regime, the lack of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, all the way down to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead people, we were able to release our country and <unk> the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with a lot of other women, to rebuild the civilian civil society -- <unk> a massive transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation and national value."
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about developing capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a women's movement -- leaders, very <unk> orientation to advocate for the women's autonomy autonomy and for our right of the woman and for our right to participate in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of selfish domination of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won an Australian National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
And yet, very recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of old mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their livestock were the human rights of human rights and their lack of respect for law.
Our society, made up for a political mindset -- more of the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the cones of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm more here today to say that we, as nation, we choose badly, we make a wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought up peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish domination of domination and so much for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election that I just needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the women's rendering of the female most of you need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to call it
We need to stop acting as an outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also putting it in practice <unk> instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs in order to get to peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all Islamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> female and <unk> that embraces all the humanity that men and women who all tribes and all villages have <unk>
And so, just like the <unk> covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all existence.
This is what you say, "My preference for all of the things."
This is what you say, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a spooky question, which has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that they all do a long question: Why is it going to be left?
Why was anybody going to stay with a man who would love him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, which I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where each year, millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical of domestic violence survivor.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of the list of <unk> and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all races, all the <unk> every income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or <unk> or saying otherwise, in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to be able to find <unk> which is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who weighed it, and I was actually a very typical victim of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and girls about that age are killed every year by mates, <unk> and husbands -- in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college of the <unk> <unk> and she was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of the <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me: that was list, that he had gone to Harvard, who would put passion to help teenage girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the bachelor's of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I mean, I left my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering my head at a physical physical, financial trap <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site is supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
And the other one kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns because of the trauma that lived in a small doctor.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted me my hand, my life was already seriously serious every single minute of every day.
The first physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit out of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we live happy forever, because I loved her and he loved it, and he also wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent twice as much as our honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I would take a bunch of times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he took over the traffic and threw me a Big Mac your face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I was very good at company.
So back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help to try to get them to deal with the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we were the victims, we know something that normally you are <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence are happening after the victim has given the ability to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent harassment, even after the <unk> has reverted back to married, <unk> of financial resources, engineering system manipulation to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why you're just not going?
I was able to go away from one last <unk> to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who was loved so much, I would have killed if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told you all over the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, all of the unknown, and I'm here today because all of you will get me."
We have the tendency to connect victims to the victims as headlines like headlines -- women -- African-American goods ...
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people is a way to say "Law is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also admit that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and to embrace their lives and lives and happy lives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I got married with a cute little guy and kind and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to go back to have ever more, is a gun loaded with my head in someone who says they will.
At this moment, as you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which silly <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting her daughter, to sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love crazy breaking the silence.
And I'm still doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would take the abuse of the light, talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> people have a <unk> future.
We have the early signs of violence to intervene with consciously, to stop your climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call Cameron Cameron -- and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed up like that.  luckily, I was doing clothes for <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them off, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
It looks powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a <unk> in real life.
And I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I <unk> the back of the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one I made two days ago for the work, there are very little things that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model of a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I am the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, over the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> also we've been associated with a high and <unk> shape, shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now show <unk> and maybe there are some lovers from the fashion to <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York mentioned every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just -- just <unk> -- less than four percent, they were not <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then what I would really say to each of these girls is: Why? You can be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, that's why I want to be model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get down your studies, and you have a record and a few jobs on your back, whether it doesn't matter what you're going to do, that is, if you assume you want to be president of the United States, but you have a <unk> <unk> of inner clothes within 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I got in, and the first time I was wearing a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering personal land, but it was a child.
This is how I went along with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and at <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can do this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to make things for free?
I have too many <unk> and I have never use, except the <unk> but the privileges I get involved in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> you jumped a red light -- and of course, we had a red light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> an <unk> agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges to look like, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for what they look like.
I live in New York City, and the past year, of teenage girls who are couple and 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, not a matter of <unk>
It is how many times I got <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I learned that for 53 percent of 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer to be waiting for is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and I said.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative creative, ingenious and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never call in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my day every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, you know, with a little thinner and the brightest hair, to be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> clothes, but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of race and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain from this talk, I hope that you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was great enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos -- and I wasn't myself who <unk>
There were no <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum of care in enlightenment.
In fact, most of them have been taken by tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and the 5.
He gave us that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
This is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture to deliver the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never had no one to do with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much our life would change us this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches back new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope for the whole year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the call of dolls that <unk> out of little previous previous players.
And he described to me what I felt at five years of standing in that place.
<unk> that remembered their heart will be able to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I didn't go out of many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that pulls the picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and not <unk> in front of someone and ask him, "Let's get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs as well as silly silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>    So my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the West <unk> -- where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 <unk>
So why is it that <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> <unk>
They cut the cadavers down to bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that they won't be <unk> and caused great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and <unk> Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, it's a few very important things to go to open sky open in places like Tibet, there's no place to bury the dead or wood and <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered species of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey on the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge pump of time to <unk> The number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this by birds. They cut it by half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there are a horrible trade trading trade to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel all over different countries, so to focus on an locally issue is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we want.
How can you help? It can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you would report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw them flying <unk> without the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> <unk> young people, but I didn't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a nonprofit NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of doing that, everything you would have to do that is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where we were about Italians and we decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we get to the seeds of the seeds -- south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river River, and we teach the local income and Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get them to work, and sometimes they didn't get to them.  We were even amazed that local <unk> had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we didn't do anything -- we simply said, "Thank God we're here --  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato couldn't grow this size. In Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them, "Look at how easy it is?
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you ask him, "You're never going to get it."
I thought that only we Italians Italians were in Africa, but then, I saw what the American Americans, what the English did, what the French did, and then seeing what the French did, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that they gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are <unk> missionaries missionaries and treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
I try to deal with any of a different culture as if it were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. "This little is <unk> written by <unk> who said about every economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can be -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to get them 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do that?
It will never come to a community with an idea, and sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do this?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that the man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why don't they do, for once, but not in the community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have you identified.
So planning has this point.
The smartest person in their community, you're not even familiar with it, because they don't touch their public meetings.
What do we do? We work with one, and we work with face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, and it sets up with you in your house, on the kitchen table at the kitchen table -- and that helps him find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really, really hard.
I got ready and give them --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away from you a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy in philosophy before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> not knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you for the <unk> it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then it will come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to show you, you have a little bit more like this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- not renewable <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a Kenyan journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses.
They were already infected in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few few hours -- factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talking with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things that are <unk> the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count on a fantastic marketing and you have to count on a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've analyzed and looked at the 100 companies icons in the world <unk> <unk> Company, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, just one, none of it was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- <unk> <unk> in bars along with their bedtime comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that you look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't think of a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much would my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the cows for the cows so that our communities can reflect on our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild giants that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, and I trust a city.
It's always supporting the music.  There is a victim in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures of the world, but also one with the most abandoned property of the U.S.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
It was sudden his death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this was a profound gratitude for the time that I lived with it.
It gave the most significant things about my life today.
But let's try to keep this look at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget that really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house house on a giant <unk> and painted on her sentences for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflecting on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what this experiment is, but the next day the wall was filled and I kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die of dying -- I want to be <unk> --  Before I die of dying -- I want to be <unk> on the line of <unk>
I want to die for millions of people for millions of people."
He tried to die -- I want to plant a <unk>
He tried to die out of the <unk>
I want to die for them once more."
He tried to die to the rescue rescue.
Before I die of dying I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in tough times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It is about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection of reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in civic center, we made a kit and now have been taken walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to keep your perspective and remember that life is a short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that would be more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care as individuals and as the community and with more media to share hope, and the stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
No talk about it, but it transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happen what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this. It's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to speak words that I could not even remember -- it reminds me of one thing: The little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but he remembers the year that she came out every year of my iPod, conversations we kept when I was four years old, she would pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds did not tweak the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you don't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual is deployed in each individual in a different way, which is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, you're diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
It took a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine, looking at the washing machine, and eat anything there was <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish they were just just like me.
But I look back at the things that I've been taught about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could take it a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and tell you, would you not have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and, honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> progress and the change dies at the time when we tried to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher of communications, which would give a type of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with his big minds with his big minds and his big books and his great words.
But when those conversations, those conversations, I felt what was going on, must have felt when he fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students. They were surprised the ideas they used to do, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are those who are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy to environment and health care -- each other, and if we don't know what we understand about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and engineering is attractive.
First question to ask you, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, they can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make dumb ones.
Instead, as Einstein said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies and analogies -- these are ways of hook and <unk> with their content.
And when you introduce your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by what they call <unk>  What do they do <unk> bullets kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it gets too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of example, Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> phrase that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Though there was an editor at the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge without import <unk> platform or principle, and when he <unk> he gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said to the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who faced <unk>
They brought him in the Tower of London and he said, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
You put all kinds of suggestions that you could have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a given time.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired -- <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be a Washington <unk>
They didn't want to call it a King if he would give him to him or her second ideas.
So they wanted to give the title of the oldest and more <unk> <unk> that you came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. He didn't invent the title. There was before, but it only meant <unk> that would be <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really an insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will do it seriously with a ridiculous title and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I was able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to continue there, waiting for the Senate in the action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep us waiting for the extra years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this to you, is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at copying the largest economy and a fleet of aerial aerial vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So ultimately I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looking at it, well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the type of 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate I won the <unk> House because no one is going to be able to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really reality changes the words that they could change the reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> <unk> and stones with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> that holds her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> that I met the control and dropped countless feet in that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole, to risk their lives without a reward and a reward dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO which is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not such a degree.
When we end up talking to me -- I was very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me dressed up the stomach and weeks later, I went to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
And sometimes I thought my second home.
But this time, we have dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of African Africans during the entire slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> 50,000 of us today.
However, today, you can pay entire families for generations to tax <unk>
<unk> slavery takes profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work in order to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under threat and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody in the world, and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It was at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families locked together in a heavy cloak of <unk> stack bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and the lead to the furnaces are going to be hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee left to eat, no to drink, and severe <unk> made it <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera turned too hot and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my very quickly side, and he said to me, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that I demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't the citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they already were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for their liberation and he trusted the <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles on the ground up to trucks to trucks and down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge and children put them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness I told me that it would be difficult for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
It took me for a little bit of stairs <unk> that gave this dirty basement, faint <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as you know the craft, they're local for forced prostitution, <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven -- they're forced to go and entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each put is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse for their clients.
From the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what was supposed to be stuck in that <unk>
I only had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows enough to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we played a very difficult subject -- it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year to sex each year.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families embedded in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> hands of black are the father, the blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children standing on Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to have a quick look.
I saw what it seemed like to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids -- it makes sense right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The kids are separated from their <unk> <unk> families, and they were forced to work with extensive <unk> on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was a subject that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear -- they get to the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since I remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like the whole life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> this is the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one of the time.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes what's possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bicycle.
He asked us to take it through a dirt path to the forest.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we began to go down, we took the <unk> that I took the road and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put up the photos of photos about my head as they put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of them, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field and all were filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had a child strapped to their backs, and while they were looking for gold gold, to get them in water with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching her eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area in which they would take the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to each other, on the side, we see all the way on the side, and we see the kids.
They are all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> by mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who force him to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines of 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has <unk> and yet, it's also forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and educated with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and is this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them, and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens to me that I don't think about these many beautiful people -- <unk> that I've had the great honor to know about.
I hope that these images wake up a force in those who you see in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a particular problem for whom we <unk> we are like the management facilities.
Nobody knows what the hell we are.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the more human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain narrative that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer in ballet.
Over the last few years has gotten a lot about treatment.
There are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there really is a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, and that's why they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if the patients could do the exam <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is you just like it as a conventional <unk> to try to try it, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone a healthy person while it emits sounds by speaking. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs, to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed to produce the <unk> for example.
And, like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time for a child to learn to speak.
So from the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as a <unk> and as the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the plot traces of you can see a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials. Well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
<unk> cost and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes such a <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals for <unk>
We can reduce our patient employment.
I wouldn't do need to go to the clinic for the pregnancy of routine.
We can often get <unk>
We could make massive <unk> low-cost cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> large-scale scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving the first steps today, by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's Health Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these targets.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's disease, it can call low price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease -- TR: Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people can not <unk> You may not know it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy of accuracy on this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on mobile phone network as well, what we would take on the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We get into the dark, in rooms with no windows and, by all we avoid the solar light.
We do the sweet models, even more <unk> the perfect skin is still more perfect -- we can do the impossible and we can take it into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11 from 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was voluntary -- and <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
And I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> people located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The registered water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers in the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
You see rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
Let's take them to different places of the villages around them to make them <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the town.
It helped clean the toilets, the giant toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I went there and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspirational I had heard the expression think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I moved through myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that they had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be <unk> very precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her own, and that would be so tragic like having the <unk> photograph.
With the step of time, they first got more pictures and they got more <unk> so it was that I walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were invited to <unk> a village to the North <unk>
Once at the week we use our scanner in the general intelligence libraries that were <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that we have in <unk> it's a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It might be an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw by hand using the <unk> areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> all of bacteria, covered in algae, even with algae, even with <unk> all of it along with the time of the time I continue to <unk> it was a very important part of the project.
We couldn't afford it, the picture unless I was clean up, and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have the guidance of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As he said once <unk> the leader of my group is how to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman brought us these pictures had been lucky to us.
He had begun to <unk> her, she was stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to put the images into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up his photographs shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble of the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in water.
It took him a week to find her whole family and know that they had everybody survived.
The day I gave her his photographs his child last 14 years old.
For it, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could remember from the past that would remember the past that would not have been marked on that day of March when everything in his life changed or <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined over there, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- the vast majority came back to their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of different photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would have to do, but the first thing we would have to look for.
This is about the project, to restore little pieces of humanity, to bring back to someone with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, there's a huge difference in the life of the person that you're given.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- to bring something out of it, using their talent for something that aren't thin thin skin.
To end I'd like to read this email. He sent him the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few basic needs -- right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go to a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to them a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without the X-ray of the body without the X-ray of the body without using X-ray and <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and switch on it and put it on a <unk> of a second, whatever, in a number of <unk> create a <unk> package of just one millimeter wide down.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack of photons and put it into this bottle, how do you take these photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk> camera.
Now, all this --   Remember, all of this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a pack of photons that starts <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the thoughts of the top part you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts were <unk>
Now, if we took a <unk> and current and we make it go down the same distance, and we see it at the slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us sit down and see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a week?
It would be a very boring movie -- a bullet slowed on motion.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the waves of the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, thinking about a <unk> at the same time, but of course, our eyes see a full level.
But if you look at one time this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and it bounces back inside and then comes back and after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you can go to the supermarket and verify if fruit is mature without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera at MIT? MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture to low exposure, it goes very little light.
But we are going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I can barely enter some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw up some light on the door. You will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from the camera, to the camera.
So we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quick, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what point it corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture in <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
We will be able to see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this from the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> with which it's going to the turn of the curve.
Or we could search survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected through the open windows by looking at light.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is pretty hard, so this is a order to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization <unk> to solve the problems of mammography health in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, turned science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect is not just for scientific phenomena, but we can actually be able to see our mind.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and colored code.
And look at those waves Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> a second.
But this is also a funny thing.
If you look at the waves below the <unk> these will leave us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes is invested in the camera.
We <unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can <unk> life, and you get individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can be tweeting a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, moving into it and make it famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
So let's go back to that city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathered in search of a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who is a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, you know?
<unk> A Android, your Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot, almost everybody today has a mobile.
But today to talk about me, from my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This shows that every European phone company, every Internet provider all over Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider or its <unk>
And all over Europe people stood on and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to and the Internet Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, and they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of the Berlin <unk> and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret East <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, which was for me, all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, I get a deal.
They will demand the demand and they send me the information that I was doing.
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown with a <unk> inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 of the information.
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and refuse to go back and forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call on the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and another one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communications.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people on the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in my pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk> of <unk>
Because the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to get them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not a way of fashion.
When you go home, you would take your representative to your representative that just because business and city agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask me to ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that will give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I went to my mom six different directions.
As a result, I have brain palsy, and that's why it <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
It's just about accidents, as the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of them in there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point of life, you wish to be disabled as well.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas <unk> they're at the shopping mall, drive in circles to search and what do you see?
16 empty and disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. That's just one of them.
There is an <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease would have the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe it in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> me <unk>
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents would send the school system to the school system and they were afraid that I was going out, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on their feet and just walking.
The other tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I read it.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the school kindergarten was walking like a <unk> farmer who has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabic in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are now 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before September 11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> the <unk>
The people that I grew up with no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that died of starvation during the <unk>
I would tell them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so I would see the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> I'm crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were working on the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents worried that if we won't go to Palestine all the <unk> we were interested in <unk>
In summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> I got <unk> warm cups on the back, I lie on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was yoga.
I have to say it's really boring, but before I do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can stand on your head.
My parents would take this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to the university with positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow into Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> "The end will have a <unk>
I've got <unk> <unk>
By the end of the day, we would get to <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater department, crying in historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, asking him why and she told me that he could not do the stunt stunt thing.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunts I can't do it either.
It was a role in which it was literally born and gave it to an actor without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for a disabled papers.
And I came home, and my first tour <unk> was kind of a little bit extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I couldn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors <unk> not white with disabilities.
They just give perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took comic books from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell into the account that he was going high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that women are not fun, and they find themselves very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival in New York City, now on her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier to fight against the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by cable has been behind Keith <unk>
I walked up to a graduate dance and I went to a study and sat around in a wheelchair.
I looked at the principal and said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the board desk for not going on the screen over the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they would not have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like I was able to play it and pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that children are <unk> but they would never get away from me no longer than a little girl or larger.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online, like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does you have?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need a lot of society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the big state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The children of <unk> a charity to give the children Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians Palestinians accepted a tiny fraction of what my parents did.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I devote this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young child of a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there's no opportunities, no job, no perspectives of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
So after maybe a year -- I was doing anything.
One day you read about a guy who offers him to take it back to dinner after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
I present a young guy.
Eventually, they go home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That boy from that little town with the dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how does a story of a little boy from a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him.
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for work, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from higher rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three out of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them any opportunities, the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of our cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few youth leaders in a corporate prices.
<unk> up to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had an rainwater on the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate college college -- frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations in terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> the <unk> the local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this different story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> <unk> and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
It will encourage young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are so desperately looking for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people in the summit of corporate entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said he could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies and now is working in the creation of the world's first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, they had to work for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and creating a business spirit culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> them in development and set out of their businesses.
They were going to bring young people with the resources they need to embrace the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create an <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, our business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park Park, this is how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
I hired hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: turn to the young people in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace than <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the mountains in the <unk> of the New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way we <unk> almost we can pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with a <unk> hearts of <unk> <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and he gets a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> department of our garbage, and that's why 11 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of products <unk> every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and I walked around with his routes and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go further into more.
So I began to work like trash crap.
Now I'm not just traveling in our trucks.
And operated <unk> mechanical and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you get quickly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting into traffic all the day and <unk> around you.
They just want to say, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about how relentless the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that waste waste is the most important workforce in the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first protective health <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective form of every day, this starts to <unk> their <unk> and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
Control we had controlled for decades and centuries coming back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have a space for what the engines of the economy start to fail when it's in danger consumption is.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just hit its relationship.
And then there's what I call our average daily speed necessary.
And so I mean just at the speed of which we used to move together in the <unk>
We usually don't get rid of us, we don't have to clean it, and we put it with our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water <unk>
We use, the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that it takes about it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple ways of thinking about waste waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to do it?
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safe from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
On one day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste waste on the street, I grabbed my little son and went down the stairs, and there was a man doing his <unk> journey as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that started to research the waste waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have on account all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor by labor.
The municipal waste that we think about when we talk about junk -- they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic for it.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next to someone whose work is to clean up the garbage from you, take a moment to do it.
So let's take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life, forming the environment of the environment where architecture is naturally born from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought up two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall on the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as a example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use much energy because the skin <unk> generates heat inside, so it's necessary so much <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate weather that goes 20 to 25 degrees over the entire year.
And third, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was really enchanted with the ancient market that is this structure in the open market where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site of the site, which is located in a much different area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, joining all the entries from the building.
And this goes on with a <unk> atrium, that creates an open space in the building that is characterized by its own shape, of sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, changing every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that will go to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a <unk> concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the dresses of the <unk>
They have the fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas, it didn't happen to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But we all realized we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the business center because in order to get more local of them to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was more economic and not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a huge advantage to putting into the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water from the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth ground floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that's so big, the biggest that I have, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also his environment, his tradition and culture.
And during that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a homeless wall of access connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first operation of design that we did was extend the streets streets, creating 12 early blocks similar to the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we took a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set higher density on higher levels and lower density on the ground plant.
And it reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving back to the community space occupied by construction.
It is where all the neighbors, they can go up and go and make activities, such as running a <unk> race.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that grow buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that they improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have the goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of opera until I had my sinister plan. plan.
I was a day after the <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table from my teacher to the grades.
And then I did.
I would hear the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of like this.
And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other fellows had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them from <unk> and myself in front of me -- just because of being there, because you were there.
I'm still surprising to me what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never really <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I'm never going to kill me.
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by this little girl, so small, so good to <unk>
Will the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies are suffering from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would like you know, take the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the lab where they study the <unk> in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know whether it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be literature.
Well, it wouldn't have been <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There is no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No one's not <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the ones that they have all of them.
This year has become 100 years of his masterpiece, "In <unk> time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we might have.
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in you."
We forgot about how hard it is.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're going so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the ones that are reduced to the person, to their wish, they are a good narrative that's <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel oceanic we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a storytellers and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details to <unk> the <unk> right?
The <unk> are doing all novelists in <unk> and that's something that I thought, understood.
Everything that she does to give pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects on his collection of instruments of torture in their private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> you like the great amounts of hair, and the cute little little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram it's so successful --  -- <unk> links the language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search of truth -- a really painful truth, in fact, how much more painful truth is better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us -- which makes us suffer, to us a lot more profound feelings and more profound than a wise man who can be able to help us.
It's telling us that we go to search for women.
No, I think he's trying to say that the <unk> give us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion that we <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that her woman would be told.
And Freud said that there was something bizarre about that man, he doesn't fall into what his wife.
So she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> really quickly describe how <unk> make us look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the harder we are, the more we are, more than we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> lead us to make the violent or illegal acts for that.
<unk> are driving us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself in the age of eight years old, I read it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they were sending terrible messages to itself, for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend.  I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- although <unk> creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to think about how our brains look like our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of which the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take out of your self and to <unk> from what you ever get, and it's under the floor <unk> your name, it takes your rings, <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road from Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, so much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live on jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street <unk> and ask, by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> the criminal genius.
But I have always been a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but we would get it to <unk> and <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally at "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you go in, come in, go back to all of your solution, <unk> it back to <unk> and say, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who don't want to leave her hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> relocated in the story. It seems to me very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relationship with other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can match it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were themselves, but their presence in the green surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest interview in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work about 400,000 people and asked the 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
It died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program was <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which came after death of death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> 50 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that the President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the first words of Kennedy at Stanford University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you can also ask, why is it climbing the most <unk> mountain.
And 35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does <unk> <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> was not just a victory of the West -- on the Cold War.
At the time, the most powerful emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great being able to do it.
The landing on the Moon happened in a context of a long list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and just eliminated smallpox.
Technology looked like what I Alvin <unk> in 1970 -- called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a <unk> <unk> but in 1969, the Apollo <unk> 10 miles per hour.
From 1970, no human has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism joyful about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems we imagine that the technology would solve the <unk> of the way to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure the cancer, or to feed the world population appears to be a clean energy, to heal <unk>
I remember watching the Apollo 17.
And I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that leather occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard that for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found us with <unk> and they were enriched that with trivial toys, things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But not the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation that in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which we <unk> Intel and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists are offered entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk led to the creation of ideas that are <unk> by <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were in their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, little investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and which development is in the long term. Nor have you invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from renewable energy as solar as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy from the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they're not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure in <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like disease or systems for the storage and food tour, but there will be famines as poor governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer -- some incredibly resistant to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years, appear to have been found effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can have it, but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does with those bill.
But it's a model that is <unk> in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of fiction fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And it really wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread <unk>
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about it.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It starts to think that it may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have that.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion surveys are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still pretty <unk> the judges -- nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost just half the way.
But it's this evidence enough?
What public opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody will tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence.
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain master of elementary school that I know to give you the reading class -- but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to get the good trial to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I was doing.
I will encourage you to have more trust in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think those people who have their savings on their very very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it -- you say, yeah, yeah, that's what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is <unk> in commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not impossible, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't get to them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are really sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I see her own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends to be <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do to do before we trust.
Trust is the answer.
The bottom is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems from accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people that have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you know the similar examples.
We put all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you were going to be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are reliable and whether to determine whether other people, officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the simple, simple actions, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to produce <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's a day, everywhere, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving other languages.
You take them and get the money, or you change it by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they same became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you are trust in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers of computers have come <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly committed to more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to the pixel down.
The designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But both hands still remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the division of Science <unk> from Microsoft, along with my mentor mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area of work.
It would be a transparent container bombsight with depth cameras, to detect their fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, you get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with the hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and note lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
And in these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and returned to things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I've got here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can be <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, that this only one physical trip.
This magnet <unk> behaves like a fixed pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
So what we did is we <unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of different levitation and <unk> <unk> mechanical <unk>
And in digitally programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and reproduce and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physics reality sometimes that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and, unlike the <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is most fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but starting to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without us that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started a talk today talking about a barrier, but if you will, that barrier, the only threshold is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was embarrassed to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes all expenses up.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After they survive the Islamic Revolution -- they firmly create a firm that there was just a hard way to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
Whatever if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera opera singer me.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and a radio radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were telling me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk>
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the U.S. in 1995, and what were the first books that were here?
The ones that were everywhere in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this trap of guilt <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my <unk> reading.
So let's get a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map that I thought out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a very <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic policies and spiritual and spiritual
For Buddha -- they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's really fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
Books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back to feeling alone or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have done with.
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that.
And that's because of books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered on the couch in my office took off the shoes and said she wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My <unk> colleague had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head while I went to the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work later, you go home later, she has children later, until death comes next.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat it.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys underneath her category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "It's still not, but maybe it gets stuck with the next.
Moreover, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel their head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of benign benign problem was a real problem and had real consequences, not just to Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take off your dream a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk>
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight out of 10 decisions and experiences and moments <unk> that shape her life will have spent 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more 40, I don't get to panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change from yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any point of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top at 28 and things get complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to take care of their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which his daily and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence of the <unk>
The journalists are <unk> names to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> what is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it was absolutely nothing.
And then all the days, wise <unk> like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't matter.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better at the day that I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game game.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think that I was married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end of it, but not the stakes are very high.
When a lot of things leave the <unk> there's a huge pressure at 30 and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there is research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son that you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you couldn't even decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, she lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a few very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often interested in our <unk> but then he was getting up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day he came his head on his legs and cried over the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and he had spent all the morning with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that goes after the words in the emergency case, please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who's going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of whether it gives me <unk>
At that moment, I had a lot of work to resist and I would not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to sit in the time the decade of Emma went ahead of the front.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who were fed up from that identity crisis and <unk> capital crisis.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity generates capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to go.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who who you know, what they know about, how do you think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak bonds of friends from their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak ties are the way we get to this group.
Half of the jobs we created was never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
At the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't pick up your family, but I know his friends.
And this was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon sends her family when she has a partner and it belongs to her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to check than 20 or even the ages of 25, and I agree with you.
But to pick the person that you live now or you are now going to get away when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill you who you would get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked in a prime art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That supply of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, that she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I sent a letter to say, "Now the emergency spaces of emergency contacts are not enough.
The Emma story may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are as planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight slight slight difference in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the age of 25, even to <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea that was worth spreading to all the <unk> who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, get their weak devices, use their weak connections, pick up your family.
Don't stop defining what they didn't know or what they did not know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> students in New York City.
And as a teacher, I took tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, I went to AIDS grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and the worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure <unk>
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy -- West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working on really hard neighborhoods, and what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the results of the learning of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, which of these vendors are going to keep their job work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a trait like a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it were a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the kids with more determination had significantly more likely to get more likely to protect them, even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of testing <unk> even the security that they felt at school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where the <unk> matters is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development <unk>
What do I have to do to teach kids an ethic work for work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related to whether it's even related to the commitment products.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not the case that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and growing in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to get them back when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure if you've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to try and start to start to start to start to start to start with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign direction, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk>
You just need a thousand to understand basic value.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, long enough to read a traffic <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or the newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a guy who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with my arms on both sides, as if I were shouting in a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of calls but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old west.
I call sweeping these eight characters.
They are building blocks to make a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is a company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretches out their arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a storm in the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a magic tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> is very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Walk the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Look inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've spent nearly 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is an <unk> sun, because Japan is in China.
So a sun with the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a step out.
A mouth that tells you where it is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
Her favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of a <unk> industrial <unk>
The magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
They were magical shoes to defeat the armies were made by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing from the magician of Oz is that the most thoughtful characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son of it.
three years old.
He wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the oversight level had <unk>  And so he slid in the room and was struck as a mom in her feet, behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> resilience and <unk>
I would feel that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
I think this with the magician of Oz of <unk>
How do you win my movie?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much invisible capital rate, the force in the movies for our children, and so little of the brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I don't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by the experience that Princess <unk> does not provide the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected that the credit of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have <unk>
Why are they still standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they, the boys, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women that write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues to be shown in classic coming up in classical after classic <unk> every one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let them get it?
Well, almost none of these movies happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the late 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had been with a friend of friend about the films that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> In the movie, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women speak to each other at some point of the film?
Their conversations are about something else than you like it?  Okay? Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality of quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus about what a movie Hollywood movie is.
<unk> isn't the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors, to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's focus on the numbers.
In 2011, the most popular movies -- how many of them think they have protagonists
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we have recently chosen for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually abused in their lifetime.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think that video videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something's wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to make it <unk>
We have tools for us as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean the parents.
I think we have to show our children with a new definition of <unk>
The definition of autism is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite <unk> character you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anybody, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to tell me about my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led to women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was to look for fortune cookies on the coast of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see.
However, over time, I got to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of roughly 1.3 miles away from the length of the <unk>
And my seawater had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like <unk> <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the man-made landscape of building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an ancient city called <unk> called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the former Egypt capital for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to get to the random note that you would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA data for NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly more interesting area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists who are doing <unk> jobs, they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, under a thick thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location, five feet down, we have a <unk> occupation of a number of hundreds of years that date from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what it shows there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones that were used by the jewelry, the Middle Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that came back from the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but they would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians on the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do you know the ideas really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long city and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we have a group of obese <unk>
They're competing with a bike bike race and go in the direction to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying around, wheels that go on to their side, the wheels that end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the door, <unk>
In <unk> the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
It's from his chair on a brown horse on it.
It's a horse that is speech.
You can feel your <unk> blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you're about to get into the mouth.
They went around and enter their living room.
In the room, and doing maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his middle center, and he singing <unk> -- One More <unk> <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow and yellow building and from the oven. The Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist -- I guess, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers look at them just once.
They would take the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
They raise entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be an phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of those competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, "You know, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using ancient techniques invented two thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches and that the medieval <unk> were used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English person, although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live, in national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So you have to start by something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it doesn't work, why sometimes it doesn't work and what sometimes it doesn't work and what it might be like.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that it didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> And he was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on the writing written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> thing was not as rare as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say they have changed also a cognitive change.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory, is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited to a bunch of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: It'll be that it has brains of some such structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on an MRI scanner, you look at their brains as <unk> numbers, faces and <unk> forms of snow -- they found that in the memory of memory <unk> in parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive <unk> is driving as an armed race where each year, someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times the memory.
On his desk, there is 36 <unk> of mine, <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the right order of <unk> digits <unk>
Half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things on these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end that is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a <unk> known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> says this: I say two people who remember the same word, I say to you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said to her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
with all the other memories they dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come back home to work.
Probably you <unk> some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two years ago, in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story goes like this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired it as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get to a <unk> it was attached to a <unk>
He stood up, he stood up his poem of memory, and he was <unk> and so soon he was, the classroom was <unk>
They went to everyone.
But not only killed them all killed everyone, but it ripped out the bodies of <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the rubble, closed his eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where she had been sitting on each here.
I took the family of the hand to <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What we were trying to pick up at the moment is something that we all know about most or less <unk> and it's that no matter whether we're not good at terms of the names or the phone numbers or instructions or the word numbers of our colleagues, we have visual memory and remarkable spatial memory.
If I told you that I was telling me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to look very hard to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse glass in your lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the picture, the more <unk> to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, at the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it by memory, the same way I would have done it -- if you would have been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then it comes back in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk would be that strange journey that made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for the word -- which is going to confuse yourself, typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea to write something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing happens is when somebody gets off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning before sitting in the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a market of <unk>
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I'd never had expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
And I was really touched by this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a woman's memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it is nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers and the phone lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. Put that they work.
Because it's based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it were a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make it <unk>
They put a kind of a deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to go down there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I did -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side. We will be so <unk> that we don't even have to be processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you should be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it will be <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from 2000 Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my dorm room and the bathroom, there was a balcony that would be <unk>
And then you all passed the video up watching television and so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and I all looked at me. And every time I was <unk> and I would go back in a towel -- all of you see.
And I was like this.
It was wrong, not and hated it.
<unk> that journey, hated that <unk> hated that <unk> and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and about those connections, but from those connections, emotional connections, which we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture tells us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it by based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build up museums of art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> Library that was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this <unk> it has this round thing, columns <unk> red, which leaves red, which is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was left another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On the side is the <unk> architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We went and we cut it up and we cut it so much, that we get completely away from people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and get back to those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, so we can start to experiment with <unk> we make the fly back ahead and over and over again, we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course we have done it in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
Too small, on a <unk> scale.
A really hard thing.
So we get to the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
Let's start the beginning again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
They were neon <unk> and we added cake.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turn them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes is <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
The <unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies these fantasies could be to the French or the French or the Italian.
And perhaps with a little bit of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and started making the pendulum swing in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new <unk> design techniques and we find ourselves with new <unk> some shapes that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of these rare moments when critical academics and public <unk> were completely on a building.
The New York Times journal, this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased by a half and a half thousand when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and communal forms.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and communal culture.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new number happened with other architectural architects.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few of these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through the entire architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how they eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings more, before I had designed this one that designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it's going to be on both extremes -- almost in <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional load of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked exactly like the product finished, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, and it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, that's the images that one made the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building builds up today, first today, we first <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experiment, of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there's no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different than now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words -- and they use complicated, and you're no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't embrace something that has never seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave them by architecture.
That means that the pendulum carcass of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical <unk> of red brick based on ideas of what it should be <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are transferred to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve for a sport or <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can have swimming in the East Side of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community connected around that cause, no longer one customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give up to the most unequal spaces -- local libraries the homes where we form our children, and the step of the dorm room to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that we like to do for time is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do that, and I thought, When stopped doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, he just wants to be loved and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit <unk> it's a little confused because, even though your mom says it all the time he's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his mom says, or fellow colleagues in the school say, doesn't know who you believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes on YouTube, and asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 20,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, that gets these answers into one of the stages of their life most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking all the time, talking about it: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being connected is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is true digitally.
What is the best in the life of someone in front of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls now.
<unk> of mine zero continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And it trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people you compare about.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the superheroes of sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as we move to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> participating in the classroom because they don't want to call attention to their physical side.
One out of five are not coming to classes at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't believe that you're thin, <unk> a lower note of the average of your fellow people who don't care about that looks.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it turns out independently of what these young people weigh up.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you look at you, not how you look at you.
The lower self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with time do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around around and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all for all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, diet <unk> <unk> sexual relationships and early ages and no protection, and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that work?
It makes this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to nurture trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs that were <unk> without realizing it.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are following is not only going to have a positive impact but also an impact of lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are <unk> points for anyone willing to provide a education in your body self-esteem to work.
A education is a <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each one of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
And now challenging the status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count on the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people so they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start by doing that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can help people based on their own effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to be valuing all their person, valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people to actually make the difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them the big screen because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who have your mind?
It's going to be <unk>
It's going to be <unk>
It's going to be <unk>
To her <unk> your <unk>
It could just be the woman who is two miles away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice, in his interior, that he would not have a long legs -- he would be able to get a <unk> <unk> <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this and empower her potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is being terrified of everyone.
But let's bring our kids to the truth.
We think the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They took the self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become agents of safe change in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
Last November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense <unk>
It was initially naive, who was naive, but being a prisoner on the other charges -- in the company of others, they started to plan attacks on a <unk> of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans got rid of an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the ticking of 1993 on the World Trade Center, could not escape it.
Later on, <unk> would be convicted of its participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with an American loving teacher, a primary school teacher to elementary school, between the two made all possible for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
In an experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want the same things in life.
However, all of religion -- all of the human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were so excited about their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the means that we can all live like them.
A few months before arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the last week, he and some friends had been going to post it in Long Island, in Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the shooting <unk> <unk> that, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the bullet that he shot gave him the little orange light on the target and to surprise all of all, especially the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the others, and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
All all, the comment took a lot of laughter. but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a van with 700 pounds of explosives on the underground parking lot of the North Trade Center, and causing a explosion that killed six people and killed by other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was just time of pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class as often was the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the whites -- but will be the new of the quiet class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons it didn't developed social skills, to put it very <unk> to grow <unk> not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera, judge people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put testing my way to think, was during the presidential elections, in 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> into the theme of juvenile violence, as I had been a <unk> victim almost all of my life, was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done, friendship, was Jewish age.
And I took a number of days out of the light, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and quite frankly, I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
By I <unk> I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to do to kind, exactly in the way that I had to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came to the <unk> <unk>
Every night, by Jon Stewart made me be honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Now, the inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and she said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside of it.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope someone, one day, who is trying to bring the violence to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that even though I went to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do that by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to talk about those acts of terrorism, and as a rejection of the actions of my father.
With this simplicity -- I put me here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that projects in their minds.
This is an incredible movie.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you and you and you.
There is nothing to raise more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why aren't we just <unk> robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective to happen.
<unk> by nature, is powerful.
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, I mean, that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, "Wow, that's the time for science to get the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a blooming of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations among some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience to see faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of evidence.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences -- but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is responding to some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they do with you with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
I didn't say, <unk>
There is no easy problem with consciousness.
So it's not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all kinds of emergent behaviors, how do we operate how <unk> work, how are they <unk> they're adapting and <unk> the living organisms all are questions about the target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for reasons that was <unk>
I think we're going to get into this point.
We have a wonderful string of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains some of the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to the scientific view of the world.
I think the consciousness, I think it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are at first <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies all that you need to <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> awareness.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time you die, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks as <unk> space, time and mass.
They are fundamental laws that are <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of any more basic things.
On the contrary, it's considered fundamental and you build the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century in the 19th century that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, mass. And then it <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- spatial ideas -- time mass, then mass, then for logical matter, you have to play the list.
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the mass, the physical processes.
Now, physicists are sometimes saying that we want fundamental laws that we could take them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could get them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think about saying, "Oh, always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some extraordinary sense element, <unk> some primal precursor from consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did you think about something that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass -- it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind looks more continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
And there's always information processing, and there's awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information, awareness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical integration of information integration called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there's a kind of dynamic integration of information, just as significant, as opposed to quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of <unk>
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the bottom of us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> view, the equations of physics can be able to leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is what puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not coming out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This is vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to embrace our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and
Some of you can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had a consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think that by thinking about, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> it's not both the fact of consciousness, but their importance and complexity.
It's also natural asking for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a lot of serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask you about the consciousness of collective collective people, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED Talk, and right now, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this full group of TED, different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that's at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
And I'm actually more sure from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental idea, which is universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we can finally be discovered.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village on Victoria.
I had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She actually didn't get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a under profile in my mother's <unk> and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What's contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
A thousand years later, I was in the second part of teaching me in a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes at the Princeton class 11 studies, a boy lifted up the hand and said, "Hey, when you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about the good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about stupid things in school?"
Okay?
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability like inspiration.
And we don't know it, and it's not a boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to be there.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair -- and you're probably waiting for you, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you a remarkable thing.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more than this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this. "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use <unk> porn term because we would go to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're going to get the problems in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that have been weird enough to express that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this is going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like me standing up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images will inspire people with disability for people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really hard to do.
So let's take a few things.
But the things that we are unaware of is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I got into the social model of the disability, that tells us that we are more <unk> because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do it, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to focus on the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people tell us, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> aren't you sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm rather than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery on the cell phone on the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stairs, has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered not to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of the people with disability that we are striving for by wake up from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a boy at the 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get paid.
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality, changing our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I attempt to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would love with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the <unk> field of 160 percent hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man -- we were trying to get it to <unk> with everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So let's take a few videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the <unk> <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a rising rise to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of time.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have noticed that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> at the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but there's nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players -- and they've asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we get it to the next decade?
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to teach you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, right.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a mountain, Russian rollercoaster for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I was a fan of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of you.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball on the bottom of the network?
What will their experience be when you get a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the diapers of diapers for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a short review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put it into a <unk> to her field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of <unk> and then on the <unk>
They were more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to his group and you see their next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight you're wearing in, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
Or you memorize the strategy.
It's just coming out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate to lose games.
If you lose party parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
So how do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You can get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad things will be <unk>
This is going to be used to good equipment for the bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to just stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
It would be the ball and <unk>
I went on to an open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you will go to <unk> and they don't get it, but the system of <unk> would you <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's an open open.
They took the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees it in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The audience goes mad, and the fans have been following it from every single angle.
This is something that creates massive excitement in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, <unk>
They want to be their favorite player.
<unk> reality is to be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you, is we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone what is literally going to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we do and the choices we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently moved to me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I spent the south end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspirational style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> chief engineer from building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much for <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will bring them on another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of you all have it frees up all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which are <unk> organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that those who are going to put this method of suicide realizes to the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the string.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they had their lives.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an official to contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were suffering from suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him, I met him about July 22 year when he got a call from a possible subject of a suicide bomber in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to Jason talking to an official <unk>
Jason had only 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had actually flown up here two times before New Jersey to try and kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could be able to come back, and she opened the box.
She came out with <unk> <unk> and all kind of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
A few <unk> leaned down on the right, and he gone.
This kind of kind and clever guy in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had had a order.
<unk> damage to suicide affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone or somebody else was <unk>
What do you find?
What about that?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't say, <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know it.
It's just being there, you can be the inflection point you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They went to the person in front of you can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to despair, despair, believe that things are terrible, and that they're never going to <unk> <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to make social isolation, social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of this year, and he wrote me this email just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be an experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> <unk> with his father's <unk>
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and told me that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been <unk> no mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I responded to a radio call for a possible subject in the line of the bridge near the north.
I got my motorcycle on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, cross immediately the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the second and a second time, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided to see that day will come back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin went down, he turned it up.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What did he have to <unk> and you gave the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I will <unk>
They stopped talking and simply <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have this letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th events of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin continues on with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I really quickly in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes to her, <unk> When I visited General San Francisco General that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father, active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather gets <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, giving me a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who consider suicide, or those who consider suicide, you don't think they hurt another person.
They just want their own chest pain.
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and called suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about an hour.
For that time, I got my hand on three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
They were absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that leaves the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be striving for.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's a hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and ask yourself, how do you get into that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model -- I felt that I finally had the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside would finally get to my inner truth with my inner mind.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to go over late, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, you know, you get it <unk> I get it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> of the skin of skin and for the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my <unk> even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
I recorded it as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt <unk>
And my mom said, "Why have you always got that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair <unk> I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never loved myself to share my story, not because I thought it would be a bad thing, but how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who will accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in culture that celebrates the mystery of the gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines of these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the principal of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was hanging out of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in bathroom, I won in <unk> and she was a third <unk> among over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was about <unk> of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that passed my request from the green card that could go to live to the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I am <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and become a <unk> queen here.
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you give you to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put my name on my name.
She also accompanied me when I grew up in Thailand at 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities, in Thailand to do the most sophisticated and sophisticated surgery and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who were living in his truth, but he turned out to be finally his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we make a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that some day there is no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Are you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you with all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women <unk> that I have <unk> and sometimes when they were called and they told me that their parents couldn't accept it, and I took the phone, she called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just a gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all gave us one gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that assignment, not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In many tribal societies, and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> <unk> <unk> made a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when at birth a little girl, their birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome and father and his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives your <unk> to the mother and no no one to the father.
And a mother got a lot about having a child.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just adult mother -- but the daughter, <unk> daughter <unk> when it grows, too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and high school to her brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years, in some ways, has a good life.
It can be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move down the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, he gets pledged to come out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes a so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that assumption they would honor the could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this idea of honor, not just affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the course honor.
And there is a more standard rule that is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and they accepted the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the old people, even if they don't will.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if I was <unk> with an old man -- he has to be <unk> because she doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
He got brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at me, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was thinking about, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was born, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she got it, when she was four and a half and a half years old, I read it in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it by sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where their potential can explore for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the <unk> form Canadian and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to screw it into their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned them to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers that were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and kill them when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and lifted up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, was offered her same for the New York Times, and I talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign and on the ninth of 2012, he was shot in <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, and she <unk> her back to my wife and "Should I <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please, don't you."
You have the fair cause.
They raise your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words took a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow crossing by the face of my wife.
But my daughter will never come back.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please do not bother you.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
He <unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, is like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't end his task.
They fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I did what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion <unk>
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you I've recently joined me with the Google <unk> group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain surgery.
You're still as smart or not?
Is it not going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide out of combinations and glue of chemicals, and trying to convince them to keep alive.
More than once I've saved me for me.
But luckily, I have a soul, of <unk> so I decided you would try to get a <unk> dose because there is really no clear map to say it in <unk>
I started to try mix <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the improved doses -- dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, and I tried classic chemical dose and chemical <unk> for a man in the 1900s, and I was surprised to see how to look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person all over the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met a number of guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in front of it, and it just wasn't going to happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do -- since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to get to the <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my creative thinking about ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those key images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you will, <unk> new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the brain works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental imagery from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use his imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, an fMRI image, to represent the brain. Here you see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you're seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos while they were paying their brains to create a huge pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
Then, I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information scan that would show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're pretty close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This has been done with the most effective brain scan systems today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and you can introduce electrodes.
I have no offer for that.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even I <unk> with the recent period of the 19th century, first we need to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way of getting larger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets -- only offer little improvements in the resolution -- not gains for thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets bigger, make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different ideas, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI was to make big magnets really big, right?
But the majority of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and bright solutions and <unk> in the Edinburgh, and <unk> radio often in MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field -- it can look at magnetic magnetic field patterns, which will go to frequencies of radio <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with behavioral processing patterns, we can increase the <unk> the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity directly. This is sleep.
We are going to be able to put our ideas into direct media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our design skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet is probably telling some person for the first time he loves it, or tell someone who she's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever done in life.
All I closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived to have lived in and out of that closet is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it to happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it will be slope of the <unk> of my own short pants and having my head was doing a little bit, I would ask a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would appear to appear on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with an <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and put it in the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a kid between three and ten years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get in full of the female issues at the table.   I had the date of Betty <unk>
<unk> from Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took a breath down and I went down and my back to my backs of a four year-old girl with a pink dress staring at me, which is not a challenge for an <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you guys or <unk>
So I took a long back, again, I started <unk> around it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing.
I have the short hair like the guy in a kid, and you saw a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am more of the kind of girl with my pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it, just <unk> <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I have lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You only know how one feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from you or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet it was harder to come out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard to be <unk>
It's hard to be hard.
Who can tell me what to explain to someone who have declared on banking on, is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult to tell your son of five years that you're going to <unk>
There is no more difficult thing, there is only the hard.
We have to stop going to classify what is hard to do with it to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to only feel empathy because we all live in something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make any security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made in, and a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian for fighting any four year-old boy who would go into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, it was going to be in a corner of my biological closet -- my gay, I gay, and the moving one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends with the ones I've spent my whole life trying to not <unk> and now the world was going around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been following for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable limbs was in my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people I knew I knew years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite group Will and Grace group?
And you know who we get <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but on waiting for desperately to try and help me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, I would sometimes say, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else does you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other people should know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they tell your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate their truth.
It will never be done by that.
And some of you can get out safe, be wounded by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet here, and you have a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of what intelligence has been seen -- a productive example -- has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as a submersible if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of computer computing as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Take a step off.
Let's first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have existing telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth of the Earth, you would see it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing that.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately experimenting, for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will define the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them, I said, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open options, with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, even an impending time, future, <unk>
In a nutshell, to intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the alternative options.
And so, by having this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal testing, playing games, in human intelligence games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without that would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing foot, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to find the <unk>
This ability to balance are having applications for the humanoid robotics and human technologies.
This ability for tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the role model.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly getting together, and they continue to succeed the network are going to be connected.
This same network <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, finding success and using the Panama Canal to expand its peak from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in <unk> and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> <unk> increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent human behaviors such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all derive from a single equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the term the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we were <unk> smart machines would have a <unk> rebellion, in it.
<unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion in the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the other thing that the urge to take control of all the future potential is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually be coming directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you search for targets we can learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the depletion of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've expanded so much our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that you go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their star star.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their presence.
At the same time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of worlds of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now is disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a scientist in the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
Could you say that I'm looking for aliens aliens in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better and our planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it will be a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world showing this for a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface for clues about the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> as the <unk> mission is taking samples from the atmosphere and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are going to remind us to remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places and the top of the Earth is cool and full of oxygen filled with our rainforests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets pull out with a great and sad thing, and the implication of some that Mars is waiting for us to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable the Earth.
For a lot of me that I like to be exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell you that the <unk> of it will be later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration, <unk> exploration, land is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only you find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Fermi asked that, realizing that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the living life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to be able to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that we will protect the origin of the planets that we prescribe this development.
It's <unk> to think that only colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and the planetary exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to describe the hostile environments on Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I had my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table in the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because I had an flight early in Europe at the next morning, and I went from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that it's not more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, living well over.
I'm a neurologist, of profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rate, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter to <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started wondering, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in your place, which would happen to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about that, but even one month later, my thoughts didn't go.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> winning the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and, I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you get a place for things that are really lost easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish <unk> where the female trees live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they <unk> the sense of <unk> and still they could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for keys, a hook along with the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular feeling.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license, you spend <unk> by mail themselves so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases innocent.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that low stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of these medical decisions and actually for social decisions and social decisions and any kind of choice that we need to benefit from which we would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the physician and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart <unk>
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you should think about what kinds of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's your fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help one person help someone person.
300.
This is because of research research researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I was exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of you will get down my <unk>
Why not? <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for some more, and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in the five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not too likely to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that low stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how we would take this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has spent five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that helps you to help the drug.
I don't say they had to take the <unk>
I'm just saying that they should have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is it requires, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air in the air of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they occur in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent the effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can make that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice too many times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things you talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it turned out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a <unk> not necessary or <unk> or <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could be lunch lunch -- so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought of rational, rational thinking and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail once in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> are going to be able to put systems in the place that will help to minimize damage, or prevent things bad at the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a <unk> of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of the door to the very easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered yet, and lots of mail that I haven't read it.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite video.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing an musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, never get to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the 1800s, and over the time of time, mixed with local signs, and we developed the language that we know today like <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country -- following their rules, including behaviors and rules and <unk> norms.
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating sure that they are covered in <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the label of sound more than the average person does it.
I'm so super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound that's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
Let's keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
And yet, for me, do it be with my thumb so it's not natural.
That's why my drawings I have just four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, and I visited museums and different spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized there were no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend, and that struck me the <unk>
There were no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to tell me more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I can experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught in the sound of the sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I showed it to the art community, I was struck by the number of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the social currency <unk>
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could <unk> it to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to make me angry.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
In that way, I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with lots of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to focus on the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new art, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note -- you can't catch and express fully on the paper.
And the same can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide it into a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and like that, as you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if it's just <unk> at a time.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers, they need to be able to express a concept or idea in <unk>
If one key thing would change the chord would create a completely different meaning here.
Same thing with the music in terms of tone <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
Am I seeing.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put it.
This is all day."
If you go to it, and you put the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other ones two.
This represents what time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express change in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Take a look at <unk> right, right. <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of them in high school.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but transmit very different meanings together.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very supportive world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have the sound, automatically it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to learn how to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to be able to <unk> open your ears -- to be able to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean out others.
The country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the <unk> school.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach and get a lot of crap.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it."
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous boat.
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> <unk> work so that children very <unk> can also participate.
And I will tell them, kids who manipulate tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, only <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would be excited about the robots.
Then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And then we put light up and cameras on hand <unk> and put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step up on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they're trying to fix them immediately.
But my students in Hong Kong -- but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
Do you see the news <unk> the Internet, and they get rid of this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown <unk> and when all <unk> it is very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can lead to all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
So we had this prototype with a sensor, and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other kids.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he deals with a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution to <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure ultraviolet radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, and the majority of the time, it looks sure, it is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching an independent way with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night you go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> your whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate rain.
We were able to see that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closer to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom in to 1.5 miles of the nuclear, and with the fishermen of the area -- we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a tracking device as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with very simple source technologies and very simple data.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood and wood chemistry, a little bit of biology, in the ground, you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard strands standard in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizen citizens, we should have to prepare the next generation to deal with the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two different design cultures fly down.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of a single silk trick.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one of it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information that was required for every cell to work and to make it <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk>
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our skin skins are thin with pores of <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One acts mainly as filter the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> personality of every designer and an architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left and the right hemisphere and the right and synthesis is shown in the two screens behind me.
My work, at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why couldn't it be done 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they connect four disciplines that offers access to access to the tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
Are we designing objects, products, structures and tools and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a span of 24 meters in diameter with an argument that some day not very far to print buildings and graphics to nanoscale facts that shine in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient architecture, and it has created a screen where each cabinet is only to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility to create a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with collaborator 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines soft materials and <unk> at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and the instruments, <unk> allows to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the immediate structural time, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
It is <unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
And its surface, like in nature, changes its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts of nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land has made trees with twigs, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
And I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made from one piece.
Let's get a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of <unk> tree of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune in to their property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We inspected chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single piece of material for a long space of <unk> 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it to dry it to find a natural shape in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet about 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we <unk> the bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and make it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk>
A <unk> tree, flies.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure that is made from shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they'll grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control its flow.
So like the <unk> board, we made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new processes within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, it was <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns out light on sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They're here for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help us build these bacteria and to make it to their function of the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body -- we will remove the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> more transparent.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches out of one end to another, it's about 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field and 10 times more than our own <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that make the matter alive?
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> human tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology of this.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer prints material into layers.
You also know that nature doesn't make it like this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of home within which they were <unk>
<unk> not <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, they put those fibers into each other.
And this happens throughout scales.
The silk worm first goes on in the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of understanding how this complex process, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch not within a box, we realized that we <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> be transmitted directly through the environment.
Often the silk worms are to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without a <unk> just <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process to architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that the silk worms are going into more dark areas and <unk> that's why we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, steal the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> worms to a silk farm on line.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready for us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> the biological silk about the silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion to all the integrity.
And in little over two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> on a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, that demands of us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever ask you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they were asked for the first time this?
Can you touch it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and took websites -- he played the guitar in a punk band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to try and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let them.
But then I was telling me for something else, something totally different, and I was going to get away on it, and I just let myself absorb and feel <unk> I have found it -- and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me very much anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing, denying all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have put back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> <unk>
So what do you want to do is you want to be <unk>
We have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you would get to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers on children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise in the way that the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what might be, don't inspire dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does right the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though adults are going to be <unk> maybe they are <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he is a <unk> and <unk>
And this was Amy <unk> publisher in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and creative memory.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The <unk> notion is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling the idea that each of us has something to devote during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and devote your life to it.
But if you are someone who's not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that they want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, so to say.
It could help if you split up in three parts of <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was okay with multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or your own your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization data visualization for data, travel, and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> and <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation occurs at intersections.
There are new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we were <unk> we are going to do that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things, and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child child <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known one.
Before I became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their <unk> and this ability helps to write compelling displays for the editors for the editors.
It was rarely a loss of time to go to what you would give you to you, even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other words, sometimes a web designer -- sometimes <unk> on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market needs, which actually <unk>
<unk> and quick learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get out of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas and <unk> and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be interacting with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them are being told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart doctor, then you have a <unk> for all the media.
That's where you give the best of them.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Go along with those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I had been alive today, we couldn't give her to her more help than the thing that was <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral treatments for HIV, <unk> for the <unk> and so much more.
But it has moved into treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the probability of coming up with Alzheimer's years or helping to take care of a friend or be dear with Alzheimer's disease.
In America, government care costs over 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs -- a five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that Alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to the most fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think that will become <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to a consumer patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to restoring severe memory memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by significantly Alzheimer's life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers on the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots <unk> they end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots left out.
This makes the protein molecules go <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and your identification is so complex, like <unk> a bomb.
We had a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we put it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been lowered and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process -- now a new type of drugs that jam specifically this step to stopping the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when these drugs are in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they're moving normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules that are <unk> in each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to figure out that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases of a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience to try to test it myself at the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to be <unk> more and more personal questions and then both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
So here is a couple of questions.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number three: When did it go?
And <unk>
In <unk> which is <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number four: <unk> really excited about your partner what you like to do, or it would be very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited everything from the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of romantic love, but, of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion of testing this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
And yet, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column love -- it was a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask yourself, they go in there.
And the reason I think they're questioning this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the article was published so much that was so nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had forced me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred and a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousands of them.
And that came a good burden on a relatively new relationship.
But as I had had no idea.
The paper was released on a Friday night on Friday night, and the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I already had called today's <unk> and "Good <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing <unk> on their own <unk> experience, but another thing is to find that life and loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or about what they did every day for weeks, they were the first question: they still follow the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox in my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared on immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship to international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable and ask about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every question that we both did a public emergence together.
I went through television interviews, and <unk> the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love, not just an adventure, but love real, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt about everything, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going to get them together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 fewer questions that interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the purpose of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal focus between college students, using what they were doing, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants became closer after doing -- several later studies, they also used the <unk> protocol for <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used by members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people in the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this piece, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like this.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom I read it?
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But that became better friends?
<unk> that I did have managed to get better known after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had this relationship since I had 20, which was virtually all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I pushed into science.
And I did everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to research for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met myself with the romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used to be then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I came from.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is an obvious one, not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> on the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story was told that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate something of the <unk> risk and this is a very scary story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And its content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question is, let's say, let's ask you more hard questions like, "How do you decide who your love deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in the question of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I implemented a study designed to create romantic love, we will keep still together, and I'm very upset.
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- <unk> love didn't happen.
They fell in love with me because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but at the time, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would have to take that decision, and how much times will I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded about 36 questions, having chosen to love someone so generous, and kind of fun and funny that election in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what we're going to do, and what you might have to spend my life looking for is that the myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest forest.
A time ago, a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later to me.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar ticket a pen and a <unk> in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some <unk> strangers or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time given I was in <unk> <unk> like going on the field trip and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Martin, I Martin, the presence of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened. In some way it seemed to grow size, as if it were to get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, and that strange bottles that I was going to find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow back, draw the same as it does about a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, let's try to make it an idea.
And then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, to go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window and then another window, and she had all these windows together, and I had all these windows together that make them a three-dimensional trial.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was going to go through something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where it <unk>
Here is where the heads with animals are headed by animals to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform.
But anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while in the other hand, you get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's-eye peak and spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a 5.5 meters of <unk> a tail of snake that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made out of a 1986.
They've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It brings me to my time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's a six year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material or material are <unk> dictionaries or magazine.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups, four or 12 at the same time.
They are like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's bringing me up.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 40 pounds with a human being in its inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, the <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and he covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have a layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
And in this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, is a radio, a <unk> a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
They took the box and all the people from inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these are different concepts of countries, of religion, not working.
We're all very made of the same stuff, and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts your head?
Take a <unk>
But so that this pill to have the pain effect on pain, first passes the stomach, and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and most effective system for any medication that has any effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug gets <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in blood and increase the cells that are <unk>
But they are also known by their side effects on their vast majority of negative, because in the time that it takes to the current water, it will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to their destiny, which is where it is more importantly, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the world's bloodstream.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drug that is a treatment for a whole lifetime to <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, to get the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk> from the <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery for diabetes, you can be used for anything else -- including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, that open up and close holes and close the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You know, the best people can ask, "How is it <unk>
We sent a small laser beam on the living membrane with HIV whereas these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three head.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> at the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to go to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the HIV eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They have been doing what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the best of these official agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition of violent involvement into violent <unk>
I do a field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because war has changed.
It used to be an dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements that were <unk> between 1975, and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an actor <unk>
So we have to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> at any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what that motivates these organizations.
We know how well the reasons why they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't have to.
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent struggle against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social service network and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They are multitasking matter.
It makes a complex machinery of <unk> stations, radio stations, TV websites and Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups invest in a complex fundraising <unk> funds, but by using <unk> business for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put their professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population offering something that the state of not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan broke by war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be understood as well as the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow them to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we only think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill together universal gaps by the government, and arise as armed groups and politicians, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated time is these organizations, we can be able to get it to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all its <unk> collect the trash -- driving the <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations not and hybrids and the more weak people are states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a single military tools.
<unk> that government empty has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If you can better understand the groups better -- we'll understand better what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us an stability.
To make these targets we need long-term investments to fill that safety line, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid it will accept the label of <unk> it would be an unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but it's pretty bad.
And so I was struck by a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews -- people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had some weird ideas about the <unk> these <unk> women <unk> with men and <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are being treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks a lot of self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that <unk> woman, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, wanted, and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would be the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as being free from bullying or violence.
We have a right to use it to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services that are <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing to <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to bear on our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body -- expression of gender, religion and our <unk> <unk> skills, and so much more.
We need to have into account these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music, at all volume.
Even though the print degrades women to women, and it offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin and yang is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
We would try poetry, right?
I'm completely excited about my musical needs.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, you know, --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of trash -- the <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and I can see the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, and I keep that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that makes women financially vulnerable when they behave.
Let's take this problem.
I was going to have a <unk> <unk> which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color women of color, the working workers, gay and <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist indeed.
It's also going to happen by this: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
So we have this tendency to put it into a <unk>
We hope that it will be done by perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself from that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative people, and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what that label is for fear of not being able to fulfill with a little realistic expectations of it.
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star to embrace feminism and making the women and young men who be feminist who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless arguments if we were <unk> it was not a feminist.
They took their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot of it.
We're going to go much beyond the sane critic and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, a <unk> more inclusive is the point of <unk>
But what's next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, going to the action and being a little more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a <unk> supply.
And these artists will not change their way to speak about women in their songs until we manage the change to dramatically affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Where they were excited about the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio banks when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexuals can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include enough number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also encourage ourselves to be including as much as we are being <unk> to overcome the barriers to decision making.
Because we're not <unk> without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to people in the power directors and film producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also tell the bravery of me -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say it above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A little bit of kids were telling me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like that.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I did everything I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I got into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin in this world.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and of course, I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the glad that I am just a woman.
I'm a bad NOAA -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need a little bit of a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border of Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the amazing things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines that are <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most of smart scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines are going to put in danger of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of it creates all his professional life without seeing one case.
And for decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued to stable only three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If you had diagnostic criteria they had to figure out why they were so reduced by the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> from the Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed to look <unk> worlds -- private worlds, to people around their own parents.
You could have fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as primary authority in the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> give that diagnostic diagnosis for <unk> but now we know that the epilepsy is very common in autism.
It was once <unk> that he had turned nine out of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child depression caused by cold, cold parents.
And these kids, he said, have been carefully kept in a fridge you don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young men had special skills that they cluster together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, claiming things like the children were just getting rid of what they had heard of their parents very desperate to earn their approval.
As a result, autism became source for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without education, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
For the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They ran a prevalence of prevalence in the general population.
They took a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit very <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How nobody did not realize these kids before?
But then I found out, I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but he avoided <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he took him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a school in Vienna, in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises and children follow their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a disability disability of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> forms for the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic like patients, he calls them their little teachers, and he went to help in the development of education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> have seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continued <unk> known in pop culture like the <unk> social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> used the limited model of <unk> by a broad consumer connection.
These changes didn't fell in <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> and parents of all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a <unk> effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected to be so expected to be able to get the people with autism and their families finally would support the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for increasing <unk> a powerful, powerful simple, and <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If we estimate the current estimate of prevention that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve by the new advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to human standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
Indeed, people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects are found in the understanding of the teachers, employers who are able to support the teachers, employers who are to support communities in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat from the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
